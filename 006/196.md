# Use of `transferFrom()` instead of `safeTransferFrom()`

## Summary
`transferFrom()` is used without checking the return value.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `topUp()` function transfers the `rewardToken` from the `source` to the staking reward contracts, to do so it uses the `transferFrom()` function. Tokens might fail to be transferred (ex. not enough are approved) and return `false`, but this is never checked in the code.

## Impact
If the `topUp()` function might not revert on a token transfer fail and will continue execution calling `notifyRewardAmount()` on the staking contracts.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use openzeppelin `safeTransferFrom()` instead of `transferFrom()`, if a transfer fail the function will always revert.
