# Unchecked Transfer in `topUp` Function

## Summary
The `topUp` function in the `StakingRewardsManager` contract lacks proper validation of the result of the `transferFrom` operation, potentially leading to vulnerabilities.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the `topUp` function, the contract attempts to transfer ERC-20 tokens using the `transferFrom` function without checking the return value. The relevant code snippet is as follows:
```solidity
rewardToken.transferFrom(source, address(staking), config.rewardAmount);
```
This operation could be exploited by a malicious `msg.sender` to initiate a trade without sending any underlying tokens. If the `transferFrom` function fails but does not revert, the contract will proceed without detecting the failure.


## Impact
The lack of proper validation for the success of the `transferFrom` operation can lead to potential financial losses, as the contract may proceed with topping up the staking contract even if the token transfer fails.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is essential to check the return value of the `transferFrom` function and revert the transaction if the transfer is unsuccessful. Also you can consider using [OpenZeppelin's library](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol) with safe versions of transfer functions.
