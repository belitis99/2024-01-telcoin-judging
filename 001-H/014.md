# Removing any token with id less than the highest `tokenId` will block the holder from claiming their allocated TELCOIN and prevent further minting

## Summary
Flawed implementation of `burn` will prevent the holder of the token with the highest `tokenId` from claiming their allocated Telcoin.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `CouncilMember.sol`, the `burn` function allows council admins to remove an existing `tokenId` (which indicates council member status). 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-telcoin/blob/0954297f4fefac82d45a79c73f3a4b8eb25f10e9/telcoin-audit/contracts/sablier/core/CouncilMember.sol#L210-L222
```solidity
    function burn(
        uint256 tokenId,
        address recipient
    ) external onlyRole(GOVERNANCE_COUNCIL_ROLE) {
        require(totalSupply() > 1, "CouncilMember: must maintain council");
        _retrieve();
        _withdrawAll(recipient, tokenId);

        uint256 balance = balances[balances.length - 1];
        balances[tokenId] = balance;
        balances.pop();
        _burn(tokenId);
    }
```
The `balances` array (which records allocated TELCOIN) is updated by swapping the balance of the `tokenId` being removed with the last balance then popping off the last element. The issue is `tokenId` also serves as an index for the `balances` array as it is calculated using the `totalSupply` at minting.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-telcoin/blob/0954297f4fefac82d45a79c73f3a4b8eb25f10e9/telcoin-audit/contracts/sablier/core/CouncilMember.sol#L180-L181
```solidity
        balances.push(0);
        _mint(newMember, totalSupply());
```
Consequently, if the `tokenId` being burnt is not the highest `tokenId`, any attempt by the holder of the highest `tokenId` to call `claim` for their token will panic since their `tokenId` is now an invalid index into `balances`.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-telcoin/blob/0954297f4fefac82d45a79c73f3a4b8eb25f10e9/telcoin-audit/contracts/sablier/core/CouncilMember.sol#L102-L105
```solidity
        require(
            amount <= balances[tokenId],
            "CouncilMember: withdrawal amount is higher than balance"
        );
```
Both `burn` and `removeFromOffice` will now revert for the affected `tokenId` since both functions attempt to access the `balances` array using the now invalid `tokenId` in a call to `_withdrawAll`. Recovery by calling the same functions on the removed `tokenId` (which is still a valid index) will also revert since the token doesn't exist preventing necessary transfer and burn respectively. This prevents recovery via these functions.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-telcoin/blob/0954297f4fefac82d45a79c73f3a4b8eb25f10e9/telcoin-audit/contracts/sablier/core/CouncilMember.sol#L339-L342
```solidity
    function _withdrawAll(address from, uint256 tokenId) internal {
        TELCOIN.safeTransfer(from, balances[tokenId]);
        balances[tokenId] = 0;
    }
```
The support role must call `erc20Rescue` to manually transfer the allocated TELCOIN balance of the excluded holder now recorded and updated in the replaced `tokenId` index. It should be noted however that the balance will have to be manually tracked since the balance recorded in the contract can't be zeroed or changed.

Furthermore, minting of new tokens will revert since the next `tokenId` calculated from the token supply will equate to the highest `tokenId` which still exists.

## Impact
Blocked claiming of TELCOIN for council members (further calls to `burn` will increase affected members) and DoS of minting functionality.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use a mapping to record and update TELCOIN balances while maintaining an array of token ids that are currently minted (that can be iterated through when distributing TELCOIN). Calculate the token id using an integer storage variable that is incremented on every mint.
