# Wrong implementation of balances.pop() in `councilMember::burn()

## Summary
Wrong implementation of balances.pop() in `councilMember::burn` function leads to  mismatching of `unclaimed` TELCOIN balance of members 

## Vulnerability Detail
When a member NFT is `burned` then unclaimed TELCOIN balance transfered to `recipient` and that index of member is removed using .pop() but before removing that index it's setting the `tokenId` balance to last member balance and then removing it, which leads to mismatch in TELCOIN balance
```solidity
 function burn(
        uint256 tokenId,
        address recipient
    ) external onlyRole(GOVERNANCE_COUNCIL_ROLE) {
        require(totalSupply() > 1, "CouncilMember: must maintain council");
        _retrieve();
        _withdrawAll(recipient, tokenId);

    @>    uint256 balance = balances[balances.length - 1];
   @>     balances[tokenId] = balance;
   @>     balances.pop();
        _burn(tokenId);
    }
```

How this works:-
1. councilMember minted 5 member NFT ie [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] tokenId
2. Now, balances becomes [208, 108, 58, 25, 0] for respected tokenIds
3. tokenId = 2 is burned
4. Now balances `should` look like [228, 128, 45, 20] for tokenId [0, 1, 3, 4] but its looking like [228, 128, 20, 45] ie 20 & 45 got mismatched as burn is setting last member balance to that burned `tokenId`

// Here is POC(run this test under CouncilMember >>   tokenomics >> claim)
```solidity
it("Burning leads to mismatched", async () => {
        //minting 5 NFTs to members, before running make those member1/2/3/4
        await councilMember.mint(member0.address);
        await councilMember.mint(member1.address);
        await councilMember.mint(member2.address);
        await councilMember.mint(member3.address);
        await councilMember.mint(member4.address);

        // Balances before burning tokenId = 2
        await expect(await councilMember.balances(0)).to.be.equal(208);
        await expect(await councilMember.balances(1)).to.be.equal(108);
        await expect(await councilMember.balances(2)).to.be.equal(58);
        await expect(await councilMember.balances(3)).to.be.equal(25);
        await expect(await councilMember.balances(4)).to.be.equal(0);

        // burning tokenId = 2
        await councilMember.burn(2, holder.address);

        // Balances after withdrawl
        await expect(await councilMember.balances(0)).to.be.equal(228);
        await expect(await councilMember.balances(1)).to.be.equal(128);
        // here 20 & 45 is getting mismatched
        await expect(await councilMember.balances(2)).to.be.equal(20);
        await expect(await councilMember.balances(3)).to.be.equal(45);
      });
```

## Impact
Unclaimed balances of members got mismatched
