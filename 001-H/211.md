# Incorrect implementation of burn() causes losses and undefined behaviour.

## Summary
Wrongly implemented burn() function causing loss to the balances of other Token IDs  and also causing unintended behaviour.

## Vulnerability Detail
[CouncilMember.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/sablier/core/CouncilMember.sol#L210-L222)
Inside burn() function before burning tokenId It calls _withdrawAll() which set balances[tokenId] = 0 then
 balances[tokenId]  value is again set equivalent to balances[lastTokenId] and and then array is popped causing loss to balances[lastTokenId] value.

## Impact
Suppose There are tokenIds from 0 to 10 and burn(5,recipient) is called so after execution of this function 
balances[5] = balances[10], balances array will be popped also tokenId = 5 will be burned causing loss of balances value corresponding to tokenId = 10 now if again burn(10,recipient) is called but balances[10] will not exist causing Unintended behaviour.

## Recommendation
Implement burn() function correctly.
