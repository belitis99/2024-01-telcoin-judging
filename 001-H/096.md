# CouncilMember.burn breaks balance of last NFT

## Summary

[`CouncilMember.burn`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/sablier/core/CouncilMember.sol#L210) removes last balance from `balances` array, which leads to reverting in `claim` for last minted NFT.

## Vulnerability Detail
`CouncilMember.burn` [removes last balance](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/sablier/core/CouncilMember.sol#L220) from `balances` array, which corresponds to TelCoint balances for each NFT. Absence of last balance leads to reverting in [`claim`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/sablier/core/CouncilMember.sol#L92) for the last minted NFT. In `claim` it access [`balances[tokenId]`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/sablier/core/CouncilMember.sol#L103), which in this case doesn't exist. 

## Impact
`CouncilMember.burn` makes balance of last minted NFT techinically zero, as the owner of that NFT cannot claim any rewards.
