# `CouncilMember`: burning a token breaks the balances state

## Summary

The `CouncilMember` contract maintains the `balances` array that tracks the balance of each token, where indexes represent token ids. Upon burning a token, the final element of the array is removed, and its value is transferred to the position previously occupied by the burned token. However, token ids remain the same. Consequently, after a token is burned, its balance reflects the balance of the last token, and the balance of the last token becomes inaccessible, as there is no array element with that index.

## Vulnerability Detail

Token ids remain constant.

The balance of each token is recorded in the `balances` array, with the index corresponding to the `tokenId`.

```solidity
require(
    amount <= balances[tokenId],
    "CouncilMember: withdrawal amount is higher than balance"
);
```

The `burn` function, however, alters the order of values within this array.

```solidity
uint256 balance = balances[balances.length - 1];
balances[tokenId] = balance;
balances.pop();
```

## Impact

The balance state is broken, preventing the member from claiming their reward.

## Recommendation

Use additional mapping to store an index in the `balances` array for each token. As a reference, you can see `_allTokensIndex` in the `ERC721EnumerableUpgradeable`.
