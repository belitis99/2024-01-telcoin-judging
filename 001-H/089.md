# CouncilMember.burn will mess up members balances

## Summary

Burn function wrongly removes last member's balance from balances array.

## Vulnerability Detail

Burn function has the following code

```solidity
function burn(
    uint256 tokenId,
    address recipient
 ) external onlyRole(GOVERNANCE_COUNCIL_ROLE) {
    require(totalSupply() > 1, "CouncilMember: must maintain council");
    _retrieve();
    _withdrawAll(recipient, tokenId);

    // @issue removes last id's balance desyncing balances array with token ids
    uint256 balance = balances[balances.length - 1];
    balances[tokenId] = balance;
    balances.pop();
    
    _burn(tokenId);
}
```

It removes last balances element, which is the last minted tokenId's balance. Now last member unable to claim his token because `balances[tokenId]` will revert for him . Also this will break minting new tokens since invariant `balances.length == totalSupply` is broken. 

## Impact

After single burn council members balances will completely mess up.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Do not change balances.

```diff
  function burn(
      uint256 tokenId,
      address recipient
  ) external onlyRole(GOVERNANCE_COUNCIL_ROLE) {
      require(totalSupply() > 1, "CouncilMember: must maintain council");
      _retrieve();
      _withdrawAll(recipient, tokenId);

-      uint256 balance = balances[balances.length - 1];
-      balances[tokenId] = balance;
-      balances.pop();
      _burn(tokenId);
  }
```
