# CouncilMember.sol :: Burning an NFT makes it impossible for some users to claim rewards.

## Summary
When an NFT is burned, impossibilities other users from claiming rewards because the last index of **`balances`** is removed and added to the **`tokenId`** of the burned NFT. The issue arises because the user of the last minted NFT retains a specific **`tokenId`** that does not change when an NFT is burned, but their balance is assigned to the burned NFT, making it impossible for them to claim their rewards.
## Vulnerability Detail
**`burn()`** is used to burn a specific NFT and transfer the balance of this NFT to a designated recipient.
```Solidity
function burn(
        uint256 tokenId,
        address recipient
    ) external onlyRole(GOVERNANCE_COUNCIL_ROLE) {
        require(totalSupply() > 1, "CouncilMember: must maintain council");
        _retrieve();
        _withdrawAll(recipient, tokenId);

        uint256 balance = balances[balances.length - 1];
        balances[tokenId] = balance;
        balances.pop();
        _burn(tokenId);
    }
```
The current implementation retrieves the last balance from the array, assigns this balance to the burned NFT **`tokenId`**, and subsequently removes the last balance from the array.
```Solidity
uint256 balance = balances[balances.length - 1];
balances[tokenId] = balance;
balances.pop();
```
While this practice is common when removing a value from an array, it is wrong in this case. The issue stems from setting the balance of the last **`tokenId`** to the **`tokenId`** of the burned NFT. Since the NFT always maitains the same **`tokenId`**, when the owner of the last **`tokenId`** attempts to claim their rewards using **`claim()`**, the transaction reverts. This occurs because the index needed for the claim is deleted by the **`balances.pop()`**.
```Solidity
require(
            amount <= balances[tokenId],
            "CouncilMember: withdrawal amount is higher than balance"
        );
```
For claiming rewards, users are required to call the **`tokenId`** of the burned NFT because their balance is setted to this index. However, the user does not possess this **`tokenId`**, resulting in a revert due to the require statement.
```Solidity
require(
            _msgSender() == ownerOf(tokenId),
            "CouncilMember: caller is not council member holding this NFT index"
        );
```
But the transaction technically will revert with the ERC721 error **`ERC721NonexistentToken`**. You can observe this behavior in the provided POC.
## POC
To execute the POC copy and paste the provided code into the **`CouncilMember.test.ts`** file.
```Solidity
describe("Burn custom balances", () => {

            beforeEach(async () => {
                telcoin.transfer(await stream.getAddress(), 100000);
                await expect(councilMember.mint(member.address)).to.not.reverted;
                await expect(councilMember.mint(support.address)).to.not.reverted;
                await expect(councilMember.mint(holder.address)).to.not.reverted;
                await expect(councilMember.mint(holder.address)).to.not.reverted;

                expect(await councilMember.balances(0)).to.equal(183);
                expect(await councilMember.balances(1)).to.equal(83);
                expect(await councilMember.balances(2)).to.equal(33);
                expect(await councilMember.balances(3)).to.equal(0);
            });

            it("burn a nft impossibilities claim rewards for other users", async () => {
                
                //burn tokenId 0 and 1
                await councilMember.burn(0, support.address);
                await councilMember.burn(1, support.address);
                
                //comprove holder is the owner of the tokenId 2 and 3
                expect (await councilMember.ownerOf(2)).to.eq(holder.address);
                expect (await councilMember.ownerOf(3)).to.eq(holder.address);
                
                //Try to claim 1 unit for tokenId 2
                //Transaction reverts -> VM Exception while processing transaction: reverted with panic code 0x32 (Array accessed at an out-of-bounds or negative index)
                await expect(councilMember.connect(holder).claim(2, 1)).to.be.reverted;

                //1 is higer than 0 because the rewards of 3 are setted in the balances index 0 because was the last balance index when the first burn is done
                expect(await councilMember.balances(0)).to.equal(58);
                expect(await councilMember.balances(1)).to.equal(91);

                //Try to claim for indexId 0 and 1
                await expect(councilMember.connect(holder).claim(0, 1)).to.revertedWithCustomError(councilMember, "ERC721NonexistentToken");
                await expect(councilMember.connect(holder).claim(1, 1)).to.revertedWithCustomError(councilMember, "ERC721NonexistentToken");
            });
        });
```
When a user attempts to claim rewards for tokenId 2, the transaction fails with the error **`Array accessed at an out-of-bounds or negative index`**. This issue arises because the index is deleted through the **`balance.pop()`** operation. Despite rewards accumulating in balance(0) and balance(1), users cannot access them as they do not possess these tokenIds. In reality, the transaction reverts with the ERC721 error **`ERC721NonexistentToken`** since these tokens have been burned.
## Impact
Users are unable to claim their rewards, resulting in a loss of funds.

## Tool used
Manual Review.
## Recommendation
Working with arrays, I can't find a solution as the index in the array of **`balances`** is directly tied to the **`tokenId`**. A potential resolution could involve switching to mappings, but implementing this change must require a substantial restructuring of the entire contract. This is mainly due to the fact that the existing functions are designed to interact with arrays.
