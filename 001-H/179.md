# The distribution of Telcoin among council members was not done correctly.

## Summary
`Telcoin` is continuously distributing to council members, but the implementation of this logic is not correct.
## Vulnerability Detail
When minting a new `NFT`, we insert a value of `0` into the `balances` array. 
This indicates that the council member initially has 0  `Telcoin`s. 
There is a strict `1:1` mapping between the `balances` array and minted `NFT`s.
```solidity
function mint(address newMember) {
    balances.push(0);
    _mint(newMember, totalSupply());
}
```
 The owner of an `NFT` can claim the `Telcoins` assigned to them, and in doing so, the corresponding `balances` value should be reduced.
```solidity
function claim(uint256 tokenId, uint256 amount) external {
    balances[tokenId] -= amount;
    TELCOIN.safeTransfer(_msgSender(), amount);
}
```
`Telcoin`s are currently being distributed among the existing council members.
```solidity
function _retrieve() internal {
    for (uint i = 0; i < balances.length; i++) {
        balances[i] += individualBalance;
    }
}
```
There is a logic error in the token burning process. 
When deleting the `tokenId` token, the current implementation removes the last value from the `balances` array.
```solidity
function burn(uint256 tokenId, address recipient) {
    uint256 balance = balances[balances.length - 1];
    balances[tokenId] = balance;
    balances.pop();
    _burn(tokenId);
} 
```
Let's consider an example with `5` council members. 
User `A` owns the `2nd NFT`, and User `B` owns the `5th (last) NFT`, with the balances array being `[20, 22, 15, 15, 15]`.

When attempting to burn the `2nd NFT`, the resulting `balances` array would be `[20, 15, 15, 15]`. 
This situation means that User `B` cannot claim their `Telcoins` because `balances[4]` is now `0`. 
Additionally, User `A` cannot claim the remaining `15` `Telcoins` because he is no longer the owner of the `2nd NFT` (which has already been burnt).
## Impact
This issue will impact the accurate distribution of `Telcoin`s among council members.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Instead of popping the last value from the `balances` array when deleting an `NFT`, it is recommended to simply replace the value for the deleted `NFT` with `0`.
