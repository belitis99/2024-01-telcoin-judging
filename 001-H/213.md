# Incorrect Balance Is Popped While Burn

## Summary

The logic for burn is incorrect where the incorrect entry in the `balances` array would be popped.


## Vulnerability Detail

1.) The logic for burn is as follows 

```solidity
 function burn(
        uint256 tokenId,
        address recipient
    ) external onlyRole(GOVERNANCE_COUNCIL_ROLE) {
        require(totalSupply() > 1, "CouncilMember: must maintain council");
        _retrieve();
        _withdrawAll(recipient, tokenId);

        uint256 balance = balances[balances.length - 1];
        balances[tokenId] = balance;
        balances.pop();
        _burn(tokenId);
    }
```

2.) Here tokenId is burnt and the rewards for that tokenId is sent to some receiver. Let's say we want to remove tokenId 3 (and total are 5 in the balances array)

3.) At L216 the balance for the removed tokenId is sent to the receiver.

4.) At L 218 the balance of the last id (5 in our case) is fetched and assigned i.e

` uint256 balance = balances[balances.length - 1];` so balance holds the balance of tokenId 5

5.) This balance is assigned to the removed tokenId ->

`balances[tokenId] = balance;`

Meaning balance for tokenId 3 is assigned the balance of tokenId 5 

Finally we pop therefore tokenId 5 is popped.

The final state is -> a.) tokenId 3 still remains (which was meant to be popped) , 
b.) balances[3] holds the balance for tokenId 5 (which is incorrect , tokenId 5 should hold the balance for 5)
c.) TokenId 5 is popped (incorrect , 3 was meant to be popped)

## Impact

Flawed burn logic would result in incorrect `balances` being popped
