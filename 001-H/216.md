# wrong logic on burn function

## Summary
the burn function can prevent the last cm to not clime his reward because of line 219
## Vulnerability Detail
when  calling **burn** function in **CouncilMember**.sol it will first update the latest council member  balance into the burned **tokenid**  and removes it from the balance on line 220 but the thing is that in order to clime the reward token using **clime** function  the balance is accessed using the tokenid which will cause an error because the burn funciton have already moved the council member balances into the burned **tokenid** so he is accessing either someone  else's balance or balance that dont exited which will cause an error
