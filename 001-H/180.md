# Council Member holding more than 1 nft will result in disbursement of fewer token than expected to Council member during CouncilMember.sol:retrieve

## Summary
This issue deals with council members receiving fewer tokens than expected during distribution of telcoin to existing council members in the retrieve function
## Vulnerability Detail
In the retrieve function we can see that individual balance is gotten by dividing final balance by total supply. When one member holds more than one nft in his address, this will affect the result of final balance resulting in lesser telcoin being disbursed to existing members before new members are added
## Impact
Existing council member will receive fewer telcoin than expected
## Code Snippet
Let's say we have 5 members and we want to disburse 20 worth of tokens amongst them via retrieve function 
https://github.com/thegamepro21/tcoin/blob/c20dde4c141cf6e8fce356b729b0bd1cdf52d38f/CouncilMember.sol#L287-L300

Individual balance = 20 / 5 = 4
I.e 4 telcoin per member
Let's say we have 5 council members, meanwhile one member holds 2 council membership Nfts in his wallet
Individual balance = 20 / 6= 3 due to rounding

3 telcoin is distributed to members instead of 4. The difference between individual balance of both scenerio will be significantly high if final balance is high, we use 20 here fore simplicity

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Ensure nft balance of address is equal to 0 before minting nft to users or replacing them with existing users

Check should be done before direct transfer of nft from one address to another
