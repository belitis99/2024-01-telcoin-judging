# Wrong assignment of reward balances when burn function is called in CounsilMember contract

## Summary
When a council member, other than the one with the highest tokenId, is removed using the [burn function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/sablier/core/CouncilMember.sol#L210) in the CouncilMember contract, the reward balances are inaccurately changed.

## Vulnerability Detail
The reward balances are recorded in an array where the council member's tokenId determines their position in the array.

When a council member is removed using the burn function, the balance value of the last element in the array is copied to the array position of the council member to be deleted. Subsequently, the last element in the array is removed through a pop operation.

[Code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/sablier/core/CouncilMember.sol#L218-L221):
```solidity
        uint256 balance = balances[balances.length - 1];
        balances[tokenId] = balance;
        balances.pop();
        _burn(tokenId);
```

Consequently, reward balances are now inaccurately assigned, as the tokenId of council members did not actually change.

## Impact
- Wrong distribution of rewards to counsil members.
- Fixing and upgrading the CouncilMember smart contract is required.

## Code Snippet
The following test case to be inserted in the [testing](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/test/sablier/CouncilMember.test.ts) will fail due to this reported issue:
```typescript
describe("burn - tokenomics", () => {
        beforeEach(async () => {
            telcoin.transfer(await stream.getAddress(), 100000);
        });

        describe("burn", () => {
            it("the correct removal is made", async () => {
                await expect(councilMember.mint(member.address)).to.not.reverted;
                expect(await telcoin.balanceOf(await councilMember.getAddress())).to.equal(0);

                await expect(councilMember.mint(support.address)).to.not.reverted;
                expect(await telcoin.balanceOf(await councilMember.getAddress())).to.equal(100);
                expect(await councilMember.balances(0)).to.equal(100);
                expect(await councilMember.balances(1)).to.equal(0);
                
                await expect(councilMember.mint(admin)).to.not.reverted;
                expect(await telcoin.balanceOf(await councilMember.getAddress())).to.equal(200);
                expect(await councilMember.balances(0)).to.equal(150);
                expect(await councilMember.balances(1)).to.equal(50);
                expect(await councilMember.balances(2)).to.equal(0);
 
                await expect(councilMember.burn(0, holder.address)).to.not.reverted;
                expect(await telcoin.balanceOf(await councilMember.getAddress())).to.equal(117);
                // Audit note: Following check is just to demonstrate the issue and should actaully already fail, since balances(0) should be zero:
                expect(await councilMember.balances(0)).to.equal(33);
                expect(await councilMember.balances(1)).to.equal(83);
                // Audit note: Test case fails here, since admin can claim due to an "Array out of bands" error:          
                await expect(councilMember.connect(admin).claim(2, 33)).to.not.reverted;

            });
        });
    });

```

## Tool used
Manual Review.

## Recommendation
Revise the CouncilMember contract to guarantee that reward balances are consistently assigned to the correct council member (tokenId). Consider implementing a mapping structure to track the reward balances of council members.
