# The owner of the last NFT is ineligible to claim his TELCOIN if other NFTs have been burned

## Summary

The owner of the last NFT is ineligible to claim his TELCOIN if other NFTs have been burned, because that the `burn` function will pop the last element in `balances`, the access to `balances[lastNFTId]` will result in an out of range.

## Vulnerability Detail

The [`burn`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-telcoin/blob/0954297f4fefac82d45a79c73f3a4b8eb25f10e9/telcoin-audit/contracts/sablier/core/CouncilMember.sol#L210-L222) function will swap the burned NFT and the last NFT in `balances`, and then pop the last one. However, the NFT id is still equal to the origin length of `balances`, so any access to the `balances[lastNFTId]` will revert.

```solidity
    function burn(
        uint256 tokenId,
        address recipient
    ) external onlyRole(GOVERNANCE_COUNCIL_ROLE) {
        require(totalSupply() > 1, "CouncilMember: must maintain council");
        _retrieve();
        _withdrawAll(recipient, tokenId);

        uint256 balance = balances[balances.length - 1];
        balances[tokenId] = balance;
        balances.pop();
        _burn(tokenId);
    }
```

For example, if there are three NFTs [0,1,2] in the contract, and the NFT1 is burned, the NFT2 can never get his unclaimed TELCOIN because the length of `balances` is 2, there are no more `balances[2]`.
Add the test to `telcoin-audit/test/sablier/CouncilMember.test.ts` and run it with `npx hardhat test`.

## Impact

The owner of last NFT can't claim any TELCOIN if there are other NFTs are burned.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

hardhat 

## Recommendation

It's recommended to add a map to record the new index of `balances` for NFT.
