# The last NFT owner may be unable to claim the reward

## Summary
The deletion in the burn function removes the `balances[balances.length - 1]` element, causing the owner of this NFT to be unable to claim the reward.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the `burn()` function, the protocol first retrieves the value of the last element in the balances array. It then assigns this value to `balances[tokenId]`, deletes the last element from balances, and finally burns the NFT with the specified ID. 
```solidity
    function burn(
        uint256 tokenId,
        address recipient
    ) external onlyRole(GOVERNANCE_COUNCIL_ROLE) {
        require(totalSupply() > 1, "CouncilMember: must maintain council");
        _retrieve();
        _withdrawAll(recipient, tokenId);

        uint256 balance = balances[balances.length - 1];
        balances[tokenId] = balance;
        balances.pop();
        _burn(tokenId);
    }

```

The problem is that the element being deleted is `balances.length - 1`, which is not necessarily the same as the NFT ID (tokenId). As a result, when an owner attempts to claim from `balances.length - 1`, it will fail because `balances[tokenId]` has been set to 0.

## Impact
The owner of the NFT with ID balances.length - 1 will be unable to claim the reward.
