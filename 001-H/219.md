# When burning a council member NFT in the middle of the array, then the balance moving logic is incorrect.

## Summary

When burning a council member NFT in the middle of the array, then the balance moving logic is incorrect.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `burn` function, a random council member NFT can be burned.

```solidity
function burn(
        uint256 tokenId,
        address recipient
    ) external onlyRole(GOVERNANCE_COUNCIL_ROLE) {
    ...
    uint256 balance = balances[balances.length - 1];
    balances[tokenId] = balance;
    balances.pop();
```

The tokenIds run in order, according to the `mint` function

```solidity
function mint(
    address newMember
) external onlyRole(GOVERNANCE_COUNCIL_ROLE) {
    if (totalSupply() != 0) {
        _retrieve();
    }

    balances.push(0);
    _mint(newMember, totalSupply());
}
```

As you can see, the member `balances` is set as the id of the NFT token.

Now, if you burn the token at 5/10, then there are 2 problems

1. the balances[5]  will be set as balances[10]
    
    ```solidity
    uint256 balance = balances[balances.length - 1];
    balances[tokenId] = balance;
    ```
    
2. The balances[10] will be removed. Therefore, tokens will be deleted from a wrong member.

## Impact

Some council members will have their balances changed to wrong balance after burning of a council member.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function burn(
    uint256 tokenId,
    address recipient
) external onlyRole(GOVERNANCE_COUNCIL_ROLE) {
    require(totalSupply() > 1, "CouncilMember: must maintain council");
    _retrieve();
    _withdrawAll(recipient, tokenId);

    uint256 balance = balances[balances.length - 1];
    balances[tokenId] = balance;
    balances.pop();
    _burn(tokenId);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

This is a starting idea for a fix. But please note that then new issue arises when `_retrieve` will start refilling the balance for the burned NFT.

1. Set the balance of the correct token
2. Donâ€™t pop from the array. Just keep the 0 balance for the burned token.
    - Please note

```solidity
function burn(
    uint256 tokenId,
    address recipient
) external onlyRole(GOVERNANCE_COUNCIL_ROLE) {
    require(totalSupply() > 1, "CouncilMember: must maintain council");
    _retrieve();
    _withdrawAll(recipient, tokenId);

-    uint256 balance = balances[balances.length - 1];
-    balances[tokenId] = balance;
+    balances[tokenId] = 0;
-    balances.pop();
    _burn(tokenId);
}
```
