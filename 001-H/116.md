# A council member loss all his funds when a token is burned

## Summary
A council member will `completely losses` his TELCOIN balances whenever a token is burned because length of balances array shorten after every burn

## Vulnerability Detail
When a member NFT is minted it sets balances array according to tokenId of that minted NFT but when a token is  burned, it pops out that index from balances array which shortens the balances array leading to completely loss of funds to a council member
```solidity
  function burn(
        uint256 tokenId,
        address recipient
    ) external onlyRole(GOVERNANCE_COUNCIL_ROLE) {
     /// code......
        uint256 balance = balances[balances.length - 1];
        balances[tokenId] = balance;
   @>     balances.pop();
        _burn(tokenId);
    }
```

How that works:-
1. councilMember `minted` 5 NFT ie[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
2. balances are set for all tokenId ie `balances.length = 5` ie [208, 108, 58, 25, 0]
3. tokenId = 1 is burned ie left tokenId = [0, 2, 3, 4]
4. length of balances array is also 4 ie [0,1,2,3], and balance in that will be [228, 128, 45, 20], thats how an array works
```solidity
uint256[] public balances;
```
5. And balances are associated with tokenId then `tokenId = 4` will not be able to withdraw as there is no balance for tokenId = 4, completely losing all his funds

Every time a  token is burned a member will loss all his funds

// Here is POC
```solidity
 it("claiming rewards", async () => {
        //minting 5 NFTs to members, before running make those member1/2/3/4
        await councilMember.mint(member0.address);
        await councilMember.mint(member1.address);
        await councilMember.mint(member2.address);
        await councilMember.mint(member3.address);
        await councilMember.mint(member4.address);

        // burning tokenId = 1
        await councilMember.burn(1, holder.address);

        // member with tokenId 4 not able to withdraw 10 tokens
        await expect(councilMember.connect(member4).claim(4, 10)).to.be
          .reverted;
      });
```

## Impact
A council member will completely loss all his funds

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use mapping to store balance instead of using an array
```diff
+    mapping(uint256 tokenId => uint256 balance) public balances;
```
