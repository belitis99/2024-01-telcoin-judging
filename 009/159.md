# `checkTransaction()` might run out of gas because of an unbounded loop

## Summary
The function `checkTransaction()` in `SafeGuard.sol` might get to a state where it always reverts because it loops over an array that can only increase in size.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function `checkTransaction()` is called by a gnosis safe as a last layer of protection to check whether a transaction should be executed or not. The function is meant to revert if the owner vetoed the transaction via `vetoTransaction()`.

The function `vetoTransaction()` pushes a new value in the array `nonces` every time is called and the function `checkTransaction()` loops over all the elements of `nonces` every time is called:

```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < nonces.length; i++) {
    ....
}
```

It's possible for the `nonces` array to get big enough to cause all calls to revert because it runs out of gas.

## Impact
Calls from the gnosis safe to `checkTransaction()` might always revert, causing a DOS.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Retrieve the `nonce` via `msg.sender.nonce() - 1` instead of looping through all the nonces.
