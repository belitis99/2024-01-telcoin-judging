# Gas Consumption in checkTransaction

## Summary
Gas Consumption in checkTransaction: The checkTransaction function loops through all nonces in the nonces array to check if a transaction has been vetoed. This could lead to high gas consumption if the nonces array grows large, potentially causing the function to fail due to out-of-gas errors. This is a scalability issue.

## Vulnerability Detail
  for (uint256 i = 0; i < nonces.length; i++) {
            bytes32 transactionHash = IReality(_msgSender()).getTransactionHash(
                to,
                value,
                data,
                operation,
                nonces[i]
            );
## Impact
This could lead to high gas consumption if the nonces array grows large, potentially causing the function to fail due to out-of-gas errors. This is a scalability issue.
