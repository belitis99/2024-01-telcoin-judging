# DoS in _retrieve() function if the withdrawal from the Sablier is zero

## Summary

When the `_retrieve()` function is called, if the withdrawal amount from the Sablier is zero, the `_retrieve()` function will always be reverted.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `_retrieve()` function is used to retrieve and distribute TELCOIN to council members based on the stream from `_target`, in this example I assume the `_target` was Sablier stream.

```solidity=267
function _retrieve() internal {
    // Get the initial TELCOIN balance of the contract
    uint256 initialBalance = TELCOIN.balanceOf(address(this));
    // Execute the withdrawal from the _target, which might be a Sablier stream or another protocol
    _stream.execute(
        _target,
        abi.encodeWithSelector(
            ISablierV2ProxyTarget.withdrawMax.selector,
            _target,
            _id,
            address(this)
        )
    );

    // Get the new balance after the withdrawal
    uint256 currentBalance = TELCOIN.balanceOf(address(this));
    // Calculate the amount of TELCOIN that was withdrawn during this operation
    uint256 finalBalance = (currentBalance - initialBalance) +
        runningBalance;
    // Distribute the TELCOIN equally among all council members
    uint256 individualBalance = finalBalance / totalSupply();
    // Update the running balance which keeps track of any TELCOIN that can't be evenly distributed
    runningBalance = finalBalance % totalSupply();

    // Add the individual balance to each council member's balance
    for (uint i = 0; i < balances.length; i++) {
        balances[i] += individualBalance;
    }
}
```

At lines 271-279, this function will execute the withdrawal from the Sablier stream by calling the `withdrawMax()` function.

By invoking the `_retrieve()` function, the maximum withdrawable amount is withdrawn from the stream. Consequently, there is no remaining withdrawal amount for the `CouncilMember` contract, leading to the next withdrawal from this contract having a maximum amount of zero according to the Sablier documentation:(https://docs.sablier.com/contracts/v2/reference/core/abstracts/abstract.SablierV2Lockup#withdrawmax)

> the `withdrawMax()` is used to withdraw the maximum withdrawable amount from the stream to the provided address `to`. 


```solidity=297
function withdrawMax(uint256 streamId, address to) external override {
    withdraw({ streamId: streamId, to: to, amount: _withdrawableAmountOf(streamId) });
}
```

However, if the `_retrieve()` function is called again, it calls `withdrawMax()` with zero amounts, causing the function to revert according to the Sablier documentation:  (https://docs.sablier.com/contracts/v2/reference/core/abstracts/abstract.SablierV2Lockup#withdraw)
> amount must be greater than zero and must not exceed the withdrawable amount.

```solidity=269  
    // Checks: the withdraw amount is not zero.
    if (amount == 0) {
        revert Errors.SablierV2Lockup_WithdrawAmountZero(streamId);
    }
```

https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core/blob/b0016437ef3cc8606e1100965dd911d7e658b40b/src/abstracts/SablierV2Lockup.sol#L269-L272

As a result, the `_retrieve()` function will revert during the second invocation when attempting to withdraw zero amounts.

Additionally, the `_retrieve()` function is highly likely to be called since most functions in the `CouncilMember` contract execute this function before their operation. 

## Impact

If the withdraw amount of `CouncilMember` contract is zero, most of function in `CouncilMember` contract that call `retrieve()` function will failed.

Skipping the withdraw from Sabiler if the withdraw amount is zero.
