# Incorrect topUp Mechanism

## Summary

The topUp mechanism is incorrect and leads to topping up of staking contracts that are not the ones in the indices array.


## Vulnerability Detail

The top up mechanism is simple , the executor passes a source address which would transfer the asset (rewardToken) to the respective staking contracts , the staking contracts are fetched from the `stakingContracts` array via the `indices` array , i.e. an indices array is passed in the function which holds the indices in the stakingContracts which are to be topped up 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/telx/core/StakingRewardsManager.sol#L254-L276

```solidity

function topUp(
        address source,
        uint256[] memory indices
    ) external onlyRole(EXECUTOR_ROLE) {

```

From L258 the for loop starts and goes till `indices.length`  and the staking reward contract is fetched as follows ->

`StakingRewards staking = stakingContracts[i];`

This is incorrect , let's take an example ->

1.) Assume the indices array was of length 5 and held the values 4,6,8,9,2

2.) The logic would read values stakingContracts[0] , stakingContracts[1] , stakingContracts[2]  , stakingContracts[3]  stakingContracts[4] (since i starts from 0 and increments till length -1) 
instead of reading the values 
stakingContracts[4] , stakingContracts[6] , stakingContracts[8] , stakingContracts[9] , stakingContracts[2]

And then the logic goes on to top up the incorrect staking contracts(L267).

Instead of reading   `StakingRewards staking = stakingContracts[i];` , it should read  `StakingRewards staking = stakingContracts[indices[i]];
## Impact

Almost all the time the incorrect staking contracts would be topped up and it would be impossible to correct this behavior unless all
of the staking contracts are being topped up.

Manual review

## Recommendation

Instead of `StakingRewards staking = stakingContracts[i];` use `StakingRewards staking = stakingContracts[indices[i]];
