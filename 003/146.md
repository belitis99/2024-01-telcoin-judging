# `StakingRewardsManager.sol` function `topUp()` does not use array index or `indices` to setup config

## Summary

The `topUp()` function in `StakingRewardsManager.sol` have input `uint256[] memory indices` but this was not used correctly.
Instead it just use `indices.length` to loop through all staking contracts array from `0` to `length`.

The expected behaviour is changing config for specific staking contract by using `indices` as index.
But what happen is it change all staking contracts in the array from index 0 to input length.

## Vulnerability Detail

Looking at topUp() function in `StakingRewardsManager.sol`

```solidity
    /// @notice Top up multiple staking contracts
    /// @param source address from which tokens are taken
    /// @param indices array of staking contract indices
    function topUp(
        address source,
        uint256[] memory indices
    ) external onlyRole(EXECUTOR_ROLE) {
        for (uint i = 0; i < indices.length; i++) {//@audit H forloop forget using indices array for index of stakignContracts. Now it overflow array
            // get staking contract and config
            StakingRewards staking = stakingContracts[i];
            StakingConfig memory config = stakingConfigs[staking];

            // will revert if block.timestamp <= periodFinish
            staking.setRewardsDuration(config.rewardsDuration);

            // pull tokens from owner of this contract to fund the staking contract
            rewardToken.transferFrom(
                source,
                address(staking),
                config.rewardAmount
            );

            // start periods
            staking.notifyRewardAmount(config.rewardAmount);

            emit ToppedUp(staking, config);
        }
    }
```

Input variable `indices` is only used as array length.
It suppose to be used like this

```js
uint index = indices[i];
StakingRewards staking = stakingContracts[index];
```

If admin intention is topUp all staking contracts at once then there is no need to input entire array and only need to input `uint length` of array is enough.

## Impact

- It is possible that `topUp()` will run out of gas if stakingContracts array length is too large.
- Admin have no way to change config for specific staking contract.
- Admin can only change all staking contracts config at once.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use indices array as index

```solidity
        for (uint i = 0; i < indices.length; i++) {
            uint index = indices[i];
            require(stakingContracts.length > index, "StakingRewardsManager::topUp: index out of bounds");
            // get staking contract and config            
            StakingRewards staking = stakingContracts[index];
            StakingConfig memory config = stakingConfigs[staking];

```
