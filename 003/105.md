# Wrong array indices are being used to topUp the staking contracts

## Summary

Wrong array index is being used to get the staking contract in `topUp()`. Because of this some staking contracts can be left without rewards. 

## Vulnerability Detail

When `topUp()` is called, the admin passes in an array of the indices of the staking contracts that he wants to top up. The problem is that these indices are not being used and instead the loop iterator is being used. Lets take a look at [`topUp()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-telcoin/blob/0954297f4fefac82d45a79c73f3a4b8eb25f10e9/telcoin-audit/contracts/telx/core/StakingRewardsManager.sol#L260):

```solidity
    function topUp(
        address source,
        uint256[] memory indices
    ) external onlyRole(EXECUTOR_ROLE) {
        for (uint i = 0; i < indices.length; i++) {
            // get staking contract and config
            StakingRewards staking = stakingContracts[i];
           ...
```

As you can see the staking contract is being accessed using the loop iterator instead of the indices passed in by the admin. This will create problems and the admin will fail to top up some staking contracts. 


## Impact

Some staking contract will be left without rewards because the owner will not be able to call `topUp()`. For example we have 3 staking contracts and the admin only wants to top up the first 2. Then later when he decides to top up the 3rd contract he calls `topUp()` with the index of the 3rd staking contract but because the loop index is being used the first contract will be called and the call will then fail once `setRewardsDuration()` is called.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

`stakingContracts[indices[i]]` should be used instead of `stakingContracts[i]`

```solidity
StakingRewards staking = stakingContracts[indices[i]];

```
