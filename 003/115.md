# `StakingRewardsManager`:  incorrect `StakingRewards` contracts top up

## Summary

The `topUp` function uses incorrect indices to retrieve a `StakingRewards` contract for top up.

## Vulnerability Detail

This function receives an array of staking indices that need to be top upped. It then iterates over these indices. However, instead of using the value from this array, it uses the value of the current iteration of the loop.

Therefore, if, for instance, an array with indices `[3, 7]` is provided, stakings with indices `[0, 1]` will be mistakenly top upped.

## Impact

Unexpected `StakingRewards` contracts may be top upped.
