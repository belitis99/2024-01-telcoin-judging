# StakingRewards Contract can't be managed StakingRewardsManager due to lack of ownership

## Summary
`        // in order to manage this contract we have to own it`

According to the comments the `stakingRewards` contract needs to be owned by the `stakingRewardsManager` in order to manage by it, this allows the `RewardManger` to send/ increase the `rewardTokens` in a case where it's not enough in the staking contract or remove the `stakingRewards` contract among other things.

```solidity
function createStakingRewards(
        address rewardsDistribution,
        IERC20 rewardsToken,
        IERC20 stakingToken
    ) external onlyOwner returns (StakingRewards) {
        // create contract
        StakingRewards stakingRewards = new StakingRewards(
            rewardsDistribution,
            rewardsToken,
            stakingToken
        );

        // add contract to list
        stakingRewardsContracts.push(stakingRewards);
        //emit values associated
        emit NewStakingRewardsContract(
            getStakingRewardsContractCount() - 1,
            rewardsToken,
            stakingToken,
            StakingRewards(stakingRewards)
        );

        return StakingRewards(stakingRewards);
    }
```
The newly created `stakingRewards` contract will be owned by the factory owner if the ownership isn't transferred to the `stakingRewardsManager` 



When adding the `stakingRewardsContract` the ownership isn't transferred to the `stakingRewardsManager`

```solidity
    function _addStakingRewardsContract(
        StakingRewards staking,
        StakingConfig calldata config
    ) internal {
        // in order to manage this contract we have to own it
        // staking.acceptOwnership();
        // in order to top up rewards, we have to be rewardsDistribution. this is an onlyOwner function
        staking.setRewardsDistribution(address(this));

        // push staking onto stakingContracts array
        stakingContracts.push(staking);
        // set staking config
        stakingConfigs[staking] = config;
        // mark inclusion in the stakingContracts array
        stakingExists[staking] = true;

        emit StakingAdded(staking, config);
```

## Impact
This will make managing the `stakingRewards` contract unmanageable by the `stakingRewardsManager`
