# Reward token can be more valuable than the staking token

## Summary
It is possible to add a staking reward contract with a reward token different than the staking token.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function `createNewStakingRewardsContract()` does not verify if the reward tokens matches the staking token, check [1] and [2] there and proceed with the cross reference for this function and we can confirm that there is not a check regarding this.

### createNewStakingRewardsContract()
```solidity
 function createNewStakingRewardsContract(
        IERC20 stakingToken,
        StakingConfig calldata config
    ) external onlyRole(BUILDER_ROLE) {
        // create the new staking contract
        // new staking will have owner and rewardsDistribution set to address(this)
        StakingRewards staking = StakingRewards(
            address(
                stakingRewardsFactory.createStakingRewards(
                    address(this),
                    IERC20(address(rewardToken)),                         // [x]
                    IERC20(stakingToken)                                      // [x]
                )
            )
        );
        //internal call to add new contract
        _addStakingRewardsContract(staking, config);
```
### addStakingRewardsContract()
```solidity
function addStakingRewardsContract(
        StakingRewards staking,
        StakingConfig calldata config
    ) external onlyRole(BUILDER_ROLE) {
        //checking if already exists
        require(
            !stakingExists[staking],
            "StakingRewardsManager: Staking contract already exists"
        );
        //internal call to add new contract
        _addStakingRewardsContract(staking, config);
    }
```

### _addStakingRewardsContract()
```solidity
 function _addStakingRewardsContract(
        StakingRewards staking,
        StakingConfig calldata config
    ) internal {
        // in order to manage this contract we have to own it
        // staking.acceptOwnership();
        // in order to top up rewards, we have to be rewardsDistribution. this is an onlyOwner function
        staking.setRewardsDistribution(address(this));

        // push staking onto stakingContracts array
        stakingContracts.push(staking);
        // set staking config
        stakingConfigs[staking] = config;
        // mark inclusion in the stakingContracts array
        stakingExists[staking] = true;

        emit StakingAdded(staking, config);
    }
```


## Impact
The reward token can be more valuable than the staking token, i.e. staking $lol and receive $eth as token reward.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a check at `createNewStakingRewardsContract()` like:

```solidity
require(IERC20(stakingToken) == IERC20(address(rewardToken), "Reward token does not match Staking token");
```
