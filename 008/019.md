# StakingRewardsManager can be DoS if not owner of StakingRewards

## Summary
The `StakingRewardsManager` manages the staking rewards contract. The access control applied in staking rewards can deny calls of the managers.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `StakingRewards.sol`, ownership was intended to transfer to `rewardsDistribution` instead of `StakingRewardsManager`. Functions like `transferStakingOwnership`, `recoverERC20FromStaking`, and `_addStakingRewardsContract` in `StakingRewardsManager` are unable to execute due to the `onlyOwner` and `onlyRewardsDistribution` modifiers causing function calls to revert, leading to denial of service. 

Furthermore, the `StakingRewards.sol::notifyRewardAmount()` function has a `onlyRewardsDistribution` modifier which can be set by owner. 

The way that the contract implements access control is unnecessarily confusing. Hence my recommendations.

## Impact
Admins of `StakingRewardsManager` are denied the ability to make function calls.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Decide if you want to transfer ownership to another contract other than `StakingRewardManager`, if so, ensure that the `onlyOwner` modifer is replaced with `onlyRewardsDistribution`. And call the `setRewardsDistribution` to set `StakingRewardsManager`.
or 
Ensure the transfer of ownership is to `StakingRewardsManager`, and swap the `onlyRewardsDistribution` with `onlyOwner`
