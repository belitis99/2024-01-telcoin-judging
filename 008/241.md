# staking contract with different rewardToken can be added in stakingContractManager

## Summary
Staking contract with different `rewardToken` can be added in `stakingContractManager` as there is no check on that

## Vulnerability Detail
Already created staking contract is added in array using `addStakingRewardsContract` function in manager contract, docs say `Do not add staking contracts with rewardToken other than the one passed to initialize this contract.` but for this there is no check
```solidity
    function addStakingRewardsContract(
        StakingRewards staking,
        StakingConfig calldata config
    ) external onlyRole(BUILDER_ROLE) {
        //checking if already exists
        require(
            !stakingExists[staking],
            "StakingRewardsManager: Staking contract already exists"
        );
        //internal call to add new contract
        _addStakingRewardsContract(staking, config);
    }
```


## Impact
This will lead to add staking contract with different rewardToken in `stakingContracts`

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use this require in `addStakingRewardsContract`
```diff
+  require(staking.rewardsToken() == rewardToken, "StakingRewardsManager: Reward token don't match");
```
