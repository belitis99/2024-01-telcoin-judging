# Incorrect `TELCOIN` Distribution Calculation in `_retrieve` Function

## Summary
The `_retrieve` function in the `CouncilMember` contract contains an issue related to the calculation of `TELCOIN` distribution. The problem lies in the calculation of the `individualBalance`, where the `runningBalance` is not properly adjusted, potentially leading to inaccurate distribution among council members.
## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerable code snippet is as follows:
```solidity
uint256 finalBalance = (currentBalance - initialBalance) + runningBalance;
uint256 individualBalance = finalBalance / totalSupply();
runningBalance = finalBalance % totalSupply();
```
The issue arises in the calculation of `individualBalance`, where it is computed based on `finalBalance`, which already includes the `runningBalance`. Consequently, the subsequent update of `runningBalance` does not account for the `runningBalance` itself, leading to potential inaccuracies in `TELCOIN` distribution.

The purpose of the _retrieve function is to fetch the maximum possible TELCOIN and distribute it equally among all council members, updating the running balance to ensure accurate distribution during subsequent calls.
## Impact
The impact of this issue is that the TELCOIN distribution among council members may not be accurate. Council members could receive more or fewer tokens than intended, affecting the fairness of the distribution mechanism.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Calculation of `runningBalance` should be adjusted to correctly represent the remainder after distributing TELCOIN equally among all council members. 
```solidity
uint256 finalBalance = (currentBalance - initialBalance) + runningBalance;
uint256 individualBalance = finalBalance / totalSupply();
runningBalance -= runningBalance % totalSupply();
```
