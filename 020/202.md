# Wrong logic in `_retrieve` function on increasing balances by using loop with sequential index

## Summary

Wrong logic in `_retrieve` function on increasing balances by using loop with sequential index, meanwhile there will be tokenId burned, thus the balances of this is stuck unclaimed, this also reducing other user potential balance.

## Vulnerability Detail

`balances` is an array which is intended to store amount of token can be claimed by tokenId. For example if user own tokenId of #3 then he can claim whatever amount in balances[3].

The `_retrieve()` function in CouncilMember contains a wrong logic on increasing the balances array.

Looking at line 292 below, the update balance is wrong because the balances is updated using loop through the balances index. 

Simply, for example if tokenId #3 is burned, the balances[3] should not get updated but instead current code will update this balances[3] (assuming balances.length is > 3)

```js
File: CouncilMember.sol
267:     function _retrieve() internal {
...
291:         // Add the individual balance to each council member's balance
292:         for (uint i = 0; i < balances.length; i++) {
293:             balances[i] += individualBalance;
294:         }
295:     }
```

## Impact

Burned tokenId balance will be increased decreasing the other user balance, also, (there will be balances of tokenId not getting updated). This burned tokenId which its balance is updated in `_retrieve` can't be claimed, thus locked in the contract.

## Recommendation

Consider to use another pointer for updating this balance instead of sequential update using loop, to prevent burned tokenId getting updated and last tokenId not getting this updated balance.
