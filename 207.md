# Different `stakingRewards` contract address by using a same index id, `StakingRewardsManager:removeStakingRewardsContract` will cause the index ->address map to be out of order

## Summary
Both `StakingRewardsFactory` and `StakingRewardsManager` contract use index to `getStakingRewardsContract`.
But when call `removeStakingRewardsContract` in `StakingRewardsManager` , the index of the two contracts will dismatch .

## Vulnerability Detail

The `BUILDER_ROLE`, create new stakingReward contract by calling `stakingRewardsFactory.createStakingRewards` method, and then , both contracts pull new `stakingReward`contract to a `StakingRewards[]` array .

`StakingRewardsFactory.sol`

```solidity
 StakingRewards[] public stakingRewardsContracts;
 ···
  // add contract to list
 stakingRewardsContracts.push(stakingRewards);
```

`StakingRewardsManager.sol`
```solidity
 /// @dev Array of managed StakingRewards contracts
    StakingRewards[] public stakingContracts;
    
 // push staking onto stakingContracts array
   stakingContracts.push(staking);
```

but if we call `StakingRewardsManager:removeStakingRewardsContract`, the specified index in `StakingRewardsManager:stakingContracts` will be poped , and the order by index will dismatch .

ForExample
1. before remove
  ```markdown
  stakingRewardsContracts  : [0x1, 0x2,0x3, 0x4, 0x5]
  stakingContracts  :  [0x1, 0x2,0x3, 0x4, 0x5]
  ```
  
3. after remove 0x3 address
   ```markdown
   stakingRewardsContracts  : [0x1, 0x2,0x3, 0x4, 0x5]
   stakingContracts  :  [0x1, 0x2, 0x5, 0x4 ]
   ```

5. add a new stakingReward contract
  ```markdown
   stakingRewardsContracts  : [0x1, 0x2, 0x3, 0x4, 0x5, 0x6 ]
   stakingContracts  :       [0x1, 0x2, 0x5, 0x4, 0x6 ]
   ```

## Impact
Unmatched array elements by same index .

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/telx/core/StakingRewardsFactory.sol#L73-L77

```solidity
 function getStakingRewardsContract(
        uint index
    ) external view returns (StakingRewards) {
        return stakingRewardsContracts[index];
    }
```

remove one element
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/telx/core/StakingRewardsManager.sol#L166-L179
```solidity
 function removeStakingRewardsContract(
        uint256 i
    ) external onlyRole(BUILDER_ROLE) {
        StakingRewards staking = stakingContracts[i];

        // un-mark this staking contract as included in stakingContracts
        stakingExists[staking] = false;
        // replace the removed staking contract with the last item in the stakingContracts array
        stakingContracts[i] = stakingContracts[stakingContracts.length - 1];
        // pop the last staking contract off the array
        stakingContracts.pop();

        emit StakingRemoved(staking);
    }

```

Get staking contract address in `StakingRewardsManager`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/telx/core/StakingRewardsManager.sol#L92C3-L98C1

```solidity
  function getStakingContract(
        uint256 i
    ) external view returns (StakingRewards) {
        return stakingContracts[i];
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Change `StakingRewardsManager:stakingContracts` index -> stakingReward contract address to zero address when calling `removeStakingRewardsContract`

```solidity
@- stakingContracts[i] = stakingContracts[stakingContracts.length - 1];
        // pop the last staking contract off the array
@-  stakingContracts.pop();

@+ stakingContracts[i] = StakingRewards(0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000);
```
