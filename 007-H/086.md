# `CouncilMember`:  execution of withdrawal always reverts due to incorrect parameter passed

## Summary

The `withdrawMax` function, which is executed on the `_target` conforming to the `IPRBProxy` interface, requires the address of the contract that implements the `ISablierV2Lockup` interface as its first argument. However, the address of the same `_target` is mistakenly provided.

## Vulnerability Detail

`SablierV2ProxyTarget::withdrawMax` takes the address of `ISablierV2Lockup` as first argument and then call the `withdrawMax` function on it.

```solidity
function withdrawMax(ISablierV2Lockup lockup, uint256 streamId, address to) external onlyDelegateCall {
    lockup.withdrawMax(streamId, to);
}
```

[SablierV2ProxyTarget contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x297b43aE44660cA7826ef92D8353324C018573Ef#code)

It does not have the `withdrawMax(uint256,address)` function by itself. So this call will always result in revert.

## Impact

The execution of withdrawal take place within the `_retrieve` function, which is called on any significant state changes. Consequently, the contract becomes entirely non-functional. I consider this issue as medium, not high, as it would likely have been identified shortly following deployment and would require the contract update.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Pass the `ISablierV2Lockup` contract address during the execution of the `withdrawMax` function.
