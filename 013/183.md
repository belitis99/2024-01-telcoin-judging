# period can be set to 0 even when constructor disallows it

## Summary

period can be set to zero, no challenge period for a proposal.

## Vulnerability Detail

In constructor of TelcoinDistributor.sol, the period is check to not be equal to zero.

```solidity
    constructor(
        IERC20 telcoin,
        uint256 period,
        IERC721 council
    ) Ownable(_msgSender()) {
        // verifies no zero values were used
        require(
            address(telcoin) != address(0) &&
                address(council) != address(0) &&
>               period != 0,
            "TelcoinDistributor: cannot intialize to zero"
        );
```

This period can be changed in `setChallengePeriod()`. There is no zero-check.

```solidity
   function setChallengePeriod(uint256 newPeriod) public onlyOwner {
        //update period
>       challengePeriod = newPeriod;
        // Emitting an event for new period
        emit ChallengePeriodUpdated(challengePeriod);
    }
```

## Impact

There can be zero challenge period. Normally disallowing 0 value is not an issue but since the council members are only semi-trusted, having 0 challenge period means that malicious council members can withdraw the owner's funds without any contestations.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Recommend checking for zero value in `setChallengePeriod()` as well.
