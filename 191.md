# TelcoinDistributor: recoverERC20() can be used as a backdoor by the owner  to retrieve Token, the owner can rug token

## Summary
"The recoverERC20 function poses a risk of the owner retrieving both legitimate and potentially malicious tokens, leading to a 'rug pull' scenario where all tokens could be retrieved if the owner acts maliciously. This concern is also present in the StakingRewardsManager:recoverERC20() function. However, it's noted that in the CouncilMember:erc20Rescue scenario, the right to execute this function is restricted to the SUPPORT_ROLE."

## Vulnerability Detail
The recoverERC20() function in TelcoinDistributor currently provides the owner with the privilege to retrieve tokens, posing a concern. This issue manifests in three different parts. 
## Impact
medium, rug token

## Recommendation

Access Control: Implement stringent access control mechanisms, such as role-based access, to limit the execution of recoverERC20() to authorized users or roles. This helps mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, particularly by the owner.Limit possibilities of recoverERC20()

Audit and Transparency: Establish an audit trail or logging system to monitor calls to recoverERC20(). This ensures transparency and facilitates the detection and investigation of any suspicious activities. 
Add emit ERC20Recovered(token, msg.sender, amount);

Multi-Signature Wallet: Explore the use of a multi-signature wallet for recoverERC20(). This adds an extra layer of security by requiring multiple signatures or approvals before any token retrieval is permitted.
