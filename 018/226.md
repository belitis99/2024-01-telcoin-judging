# Challenge period immediate effect

## Summary

Setting a new challenge period takes immediate effect even for old proposals.

## Vulnerability Detail

An owner can set the challenge period at any time to any value:
```solidity
    function setChallengePeriod(uint256 newPeriod) public onlyOwner {
        //update period
        challengePeriod = newPeriod;
        // Emitting an event for new period
        emit ChallengePeriodUpdated(challengePeriod);
    }
```

This change directly impacts not only new proposals but also old ones, e.g. when challenging txs:
```solidity
        // Reverts if the current time exceeds the sum of the transaction's timestamp and the challenge period
        require(
            block.timestamp <=
                proposedTransactions[transactionId].timestamp + challengePeriod,
            "TelcoinDistributor: Challenge period has ended"
        );
```
or when executing:
```solidity
        // Reverts if the challenge period has not expired
        require(
            block.timestamp >
                proposedTransactions[transactionId].timestamp + challengePeriod,
            "TelcoinDistributor: Challenge period has not ended"
        );
```
`challengePeriod` is always dynamically added to the proposal `timestamp`. Thus any update to this value immediately affects all proposals.
In my opinion, old proposals should stay with the old config, and only new proposals take this updated value.

## Impact

Challengers should actively monitor for changes. They might have less time than they initially thought to challenge malicious proposals. Also, a tx might be executed earlier or later than anticipated. What is more, there might happen a situation, if the period is increased, an already executed tx can be challenged, leading to the misleading state.

## Recommendation

Cache current challenge expiration when creating a proposal. Additionally, consider introducing reasonable min/max boundaries for `challengePeriod`.
