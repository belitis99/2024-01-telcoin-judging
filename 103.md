# Absence of `if` condition before changing the `proposedTransactions` array.

## Summary
Absence of `if` condition before changing the `proposedTransactions` array.
## Vulnerability Detail
After sending a transaction with the `batchTelcoin()` function the contract immediately changes the state of the `proposedTransactions` array giving the current `[transactionId].executed` a `true` value. What if the specific transaction fails?

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Write an `if` condition after the `batchTelcoin()` function which checks if the transaction was successful and only if it is `true` then the state of the `proposedTransactions[transactionId]` should be executed as `true`.
