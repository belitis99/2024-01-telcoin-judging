# TelcoinDistributor::challengeTransaction() will block the transaction permanently

## Summary
Challenger can challenge a proposed transaction. Once challenged, it is permanently blocked.  

## Vulnerability Detail
When challenger challenges a proposed transaction with in specified window, the challenged flag is set to true.
The executor will revert if a transaction is having challenged flag as true.

There is no other mechanism provided in the contract to release the challenged state.

## Impact
Challenged transactions are permanently blocked.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/protocol/core/TelcoinDistributor.sol#L115-L136

```solidity
   require(
            !proposedTransactions[transactionId].challenged,
            "TelcoinDistributor: transaction has been challenged"
        );
```
During execute transaction, if the transaction challenged is flagged as true, it will revert.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is not clear if challenge is more like a permanent block. There should be a mechanism to release the transaction if challenge is taken back, but such implementation is not apparent from the code base.
