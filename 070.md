# Gas Optimization:

## Summary
Gas Optimization: The createStakingRewards function could be optimized by storing the length of the stakingRewardsContracts array in a local variable instead of calling getStakingRewardsContractCount() to save on gas costs.

## Vulnerability Detail
   emit NewStakingRewardsContract(
            getStakingRewardsContractCount() - 1,
            rewardsToken,
            stakingToken,
            StakingRewards(stakingRewards)
        );

        return StakingRewards(stakingRewards);
    }
