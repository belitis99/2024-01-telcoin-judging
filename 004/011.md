# Malicious member of the Governance Council can trigger a reentrancy attack

## Summary
Personnel with GOVERNANCE_COUNCIL_ROLE can use the external function `CouncilMember.claim()` to trigger a reentrancy attack in `_retrieve()`. Meaning that, a malicious actor in the Governance Council can retrieve funds from all council members

## Vulnerability Detail
### _retrieve()
The  `_stream.execute(_target,...)` call, can execute the withdrawal operation from an arbitrary implementation, `_target`, which is strcitly updated only by GOVERNANCE_COUNCIL_ROLE.


```solidity
   function _retrieve() internal {
        // Get the initial TELCOIN balance of the contract
        uint256 initialBalance = TELCOIN.balanceOf(address(this));
        // Execute the withdrawal from the _target, which might be a Sablier stream or another protocol
        _stream.execute(
            _target,                        //[x]
            abi.encodeWithSelector(
                ISablierV2ProxyTarget.withdrawMax.selector,
                _target,
                _id,
                address(this)
            )
        );

        // Get the new balance after the withdrawal
        [...]
```
The function only checks the initialBalance and performs the withdrawal which can be any kind of implementation, just later it does boundary checking and calculate the split for the other members of the Council.

`_retrieve()` is called in the function `claim()`, the entry point.

`claim()` allows the reentrancy attack because it also does not keep track of the TELCOIN that are being retrieved when the vulnerable function `_retrieve()` is triggered, as shown below:

```solidity
 function claim(uint256 tokenId, uint256 amount) external {
        // Ensure the function caller is the owner of the token (council member) they're trying to claim for
        require(
            _msgSender() == ownerOf(tokenId),
            "CouncilMember: caller is not council member holding this NFT index"
        );
        // Retrieve and distribute any pending TELCOIN for all council members
        _retrieve();

       // [...]
```


## Impact
A malicious member of the Council stealing funds from all members.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Track the amount of tokens retrieved before the execution of an arbitrary withdrawal implementation from `_target`.
Do not rely on arbitrary code execution on critical operations.
