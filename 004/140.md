# Functions calling _retrieve() more than once will always revert

## Summary

All the functions that execute the `_retrieve()` function more than once in their execution flow will fail because all calls to Sablier's `withdrawMax()` function will try to withdraw a 0 amount.

## Vulnerability Detail

`CouncilMember.sol` uses the `_retrieve()` function in order to withdraw the current available amount in the Sablier stream.

In order to do so, the `_retrieve()` will call `withdrawMax()` in the proxy target, a contract which will internally trigger the stream’s `withdrawMax()` function:

```solidity
// CouncilMember.sol

function _retrieve() internal {
        // Get the initial TELCOIN balance of the contract
        uint256 initialBalance = TELCOIN.balanceOf(address(this));
        // Execute the withdrawal from the _target, which might be a Sablier stream or another protocol
        _stream.execute(
            _target,
            abi.encodeWithSelector(
                ISablierV2ProxyTarget.withdrawMax.selector, 
                _target, 
                _id,
                address(this)
            )
        );

        ...
    }

```

```solidity
// https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-periphery/blob/ba3926d2c3e059a230211077087b73afe46acf64/src/abstracts/SablierV2ProxyTarget.sol#L142
// SablierV2ProxyTarget.sol
function withdrawMax(ISablierV2Lockup lockup, uint256 streamId, address to) external onlyDelegateCall {
        lockup.withdrawMax(streamId, to);
    }
```

When `lockup.withdrawMax()`, the actual Sablier lockup linear stream’s `withdrawMax()` will be called. This function will withdraw the maximum withdrawable amount available in the stream, which is given by the internal `_withdrawableAmountOf()` function:

```solidity
// https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core/blob/main/src/abstracts/SablierV2Lockup.sol#L298

function withdrawMax(uint256 streamId, address to) external override {
        withdraw({ streamId: streamId, to: to, amount: _withdrawableAmountOf(streamId) });
    }
```

As we can see in the snippet, `withdrawMax()` will then execute `withdraw()`, the actual stream’s function that will carry out the logic to transfer the available amount in the stream. If we analyze the `withdraw()` function, we’ll notice that [it will always revert if a 0 amount is passed as parameter](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core/blob/main/src/abstracts/SablierV2Lockup.sol#L270).

The problem with the current Telcoin implementation: because some functions call the `_retrieve()` function twice, all of them will fail because the first call to `_retrieve()` will withdraw ALL the available funds. After performing the first retrieve, the second one will always try to withdraw a 0 amount because everything has been withdrawn in the first retrieval.

This affects the `removeFromOffice()`, `mint()`and `burn()` functions. All of them perform only one explicit call to `_retrieve()`, but are then also affected by the changes added by the Telcoin team in the ERC721’s `_update()` hook:

```solidity
// CouncilMember.sol
function _update(
        address to,
        uint256 tokenId,
        address auth
    ) internal override returns (address) {
        if (totalSupply() != 0) {
            _retrieve();
        }

        return super._update(to, tokenId, auth);
    }
```

This hook forces all NFT minting, burning or transfers to trigger a `_retrieve()`, which are actions performed by the three mentioned functions.

## Impact

High. Calling the removeFromOffice(), mint()and burn() functions after totalSupply() > 1 (i.e after the first NFT is minted) will always revert, effectively rendering the protocol unusable.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to only execute the _retrieve() if the stream’s withdrawable amount is greater than 0 (i.e there’s something to withdraw). This can be easily queried in [the stream's ](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core/blob/main/src/abstracts/SablierV2Lockup.sol#L117)[withdrawableAmountOf()](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core/blob/main/src/abstracts/SablierV2Lockup.sol#L117)[ function](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core/blob/main/src/abstracts/SablierV2Lockup.sol#L117).
