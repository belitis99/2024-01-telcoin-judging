# Removing the item in array without preserving the array index making other functions unusable in CouncilMember.sol: burn() and StakingRewardsManager.sol: removeStakingRewardsContract()

## Summary
In [burn()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/sablier/core/CouncilMember.sol#L210) and [removeStakingRewardsContract()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/telx/core/StakingRewardsManager.sol#L166), the protocol only delete the item in the array without preserving the order of the elements.

## Vulnerability Detail
Without preserving the order of the array, the protocol removes the last item value which is not the index we want to delete, leaving other functions when calling the item with that index rendered unusable

## Impact
The last item is removed, and the intentional deleting item remains with the last item value. Which is wrong.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a correct logic of deleting item while preserving the sequence:
```solidity
function deleteItemPreserve(uint _index) public {
        for (uint i = _index; i < arr.length - 1; i++) {
            arr[i] = arr[i + 1];
        }
        arr.pop();
 }
```
