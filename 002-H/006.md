# CouncilMember.sol :: Burning a NFT impossibilities minting new NFTs (DOS).

## Summary
**`mint()`** is used to create new NFTs for users. However, a problem arises when an NFT is burned, making it impossible to mint new NFTs due to the calculation of the **nftID** being dependent on the **`totalSupply()`**.
## Vulnerability Detail
When the **`mint()`** is called to create a new NFT for a user, the calculation of the **nftID** relies on the **`totalSupply()`**.
```Solidity
function mint(
        address newMember
    ) external onlyRole(GOVERNANCE_COUNCIL_ROLE) {
        if (totalSupply() != 0) {
            _retrieve();
        }

        balances.push(0);
        _mint(newMember, totalSupply());
    }
```
Initially, this process works as expected. However, a problem arises when an NFT is burned using the [burn()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-telcoin/blob/0954297f4fefac82d45a79c73f3a4b8eb25f10e9/telcoin-audit/contracts/sablier/core/CouncilMember.sol#L210-L222) , as it decrements the **totalSupply**. 

The issue becomes apparent when the burned NFT is not the latest one minted. In such a scenario, the subsequent call to **`mint()`** reverts. This failure occurs because it attempts to use an **nftID** that already exists (owned by other user).

As a consequence, the transaction reverts with the ERC721 custom error **`ERC721InvalidSender("0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000")`**. 
This is because for the successful minting of a new NFT, the previous owner must be the zero address. This situation provocates a Denial of Service (DOS).
## POC
To run the POC, copy the provided code into the **`CouncilMember.test.ts`** file.
```Solidity
describe("Burn custom", () => {

            beforeEach(async () => {
                telcoin.transfer(await stream.getAddress(), 100000);
                await expect(councilMember.mint(member.address)).to.not.reverted;
                await expect(councilMember.mint(support.address)).to.not.reverted;
                await expect(councilMember.mint(await stream.getAddress())).to.not.reverted;
            });

            it("if a NFT is burned impossibilities mint new NFT", async () => {
                await councilMember.burn(0, support.address);
                await expect(councilMember.mint(member.address)).to.revertedWithCustomError(councilMember, "ERC721InvalidSender");
            });
        });
```
## Impact
New NFTs can't be minted (DOS).

## Tool used
Manual Review.
## Recommendation
To address this issue, introduce a state variable that increments with each minted NFT.
```Solidity
uint256 nftID;
```
```diff
function mint(
        address newMember
    ) external onlyRole(GOVERNANCE_COUNCIL_ROLE) {
        if (totalSupply() != 0) {
            _retrieve();
        }

        balances.push(0);
-       _mint(newMember, totalSupply());
+       _mint(newMember, nftID);
+       nftID++
    }
```
