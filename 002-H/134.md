# Minting new tokens becomes permanently impossible unless the last NFT is burned

## Summary

The `mint` function uses the `totalSupply` to mint the next NFT, however, if not the last NFT is burned, the `totalSupply` will be equal to the Id of the last NFT, causing a revert in `mint`.

## Vulnerability Detail

The [`mint`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-telcoin/blob/0954297f4fefac82d45a79c73f3a4b8eb25f10e9/telcoin-audit/contracts/sablier/core/CouncilMember.sol#L210-L222) function uses the `totalSupply` to mint the next NFT, but the `totalSupply` can be decreased by `burn`, `mint` may mints existed NFT and reverts.

```solidity
    function mint(
        address newMember
    ) external onlyRole(GOVERNANCE_COUNCIL_ROLE) {
        if (totalSupply() != 0) {
            _retrieve();
        }

        balances.push(0);
        _mint(newMember, totalSupply());
    }
```

For example, if two NFTs [0,1] are in the contract, and the NFT0 is burned, you cannot mint new NFTs.
Add the test to `telcoin-audit/test/sablier/CouncilMember.test.ts` and run it with `npx hardhat test`.

## Impact

Minting new tokens becomes permanently impossible unless the last NFT is burned.

## Tool used

hardhat 

## Recommendation

It's recommended to use a self-increasing counter to calculate the next NFT's ID.
