# we can't call mint function after we called burn funciton

## Summary
the mint function will revert  after we called the burn function

## Vulnerability Detail
since the mint function uses **totalsupply()** to mint the **tokenid** we might try to mint the same **tokenid** which will cause a revert  so lets say the governance called the mint function  and at that time **totalsupply()** was 10 then  that token was minted which means the **totalsupply**() will be 11   the burn function was called to burn the **tokenid** of 5  which will make the totalsupply back to 10 so if we ever tried to mint a token it will try to mint an already minted **tokenid** which is 10
## Impact
can cause the function to stop working

## Recommendation
 don't use totalsupply() as tokenid
