# There is an issue in the logic when minting a new NFT.

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
When burning an already minted token, the associated token `ID` is removed. 
```solidity
function burn(uint256 tokenId, address recipient) {
    _burn(tokenId);
}
```
Subsequently, when minting a new token, the newly created token `ID` should be set to the current total supply.
```solidity
function mint(address newMember) {
    _mint(newMember, totalSupply());
}
```
There is a notable logic error in this scenario. 
For instance, if we have already minted `5` tokens with `ID`s `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`, and then we delete the token with `ID` `1`, the current total supply becomes `4`. 
Now, when attempting to create a new council member, the logic tries to mint a new `NFT` with token `ID` `4`. 
However, token `ID` `4` has already been minted, resulting in the failure of any attempts to mint a new `NFT`.
## Impact
Once any `NFT` is deleted, it becomes impossible to add a new council member.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The newly created token `ID` should not be the current total supply. 
Instead, it is advisable to store this value separately to avoid potential issues.
