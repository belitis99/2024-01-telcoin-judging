# CouncilMember.burn stops all future mints

## Summary

[`CouncilMember.burn`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/sablier/core/CouncilMember.sol#L210) removes element from `_allTokens` array in `ERC721EnumerableUpgradeable` contract, which leads to reverting in every future `mint`.

## Vulnerability Detail

`CouncilMember.burn` removes element from `_allTokens` array in `ERC721EnumerableUpgradeable` contract, thus decreasing  length of  `_allTokens` array, which equals to `totalSupply()`. [`totalSupply()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/sablier/core/CouncilMember.sol#L181) is used as a new `tokenId` in `mint` method, every `mint` after `burn` will try to mint already existing `tokenId`, thus leading to reverting.  

## Impact
`CouncilMember.burn` breaks contract logic, making future minting of NFTs unavaliable.

## Recommendation

Don't [use `totalSupply` as next `tokenId` in `mint`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/sablier/core/CouncilMember.sol#L181). Instead use custom counter within the contract.
