# Approvals persist when a CouncilMember is burned and the id is later reminted

## Summary

When a `CouncilMember` is burned, the approved address remains set and will remain set if the id is reminted.

## Vulnerability Detail

Approvals are stored in the `_tokenApproval` mapping which is not cleared when a token is burned then reminted.

## Impact

If a token is burned and assumed to be gone, then later reminted to a new user it is possible that the approved address may relate to the old user and be incorrect. This could potentially lead to another account being able to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of another user.

```solidity
function burn(
        uint256 tokenId,
        address recipient
    ) external onlyRole(GOVERNANCE_COUNCIL_ROLE) {
        require(totalSupply() > 1, "CouncilMember: must maintain council");
        _retrieve();
        _withdrawAll(recipient, tokenId);

        uint256 balance = balances[balances.length - 1];
        balances[tokenId] = balance;
        balances.pop();
        _burn(tokenId);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Clear the `_tokenApproval` mapping in the `burn` function

```solidity
_tokenApproval[tokenId]=address(0);
```
