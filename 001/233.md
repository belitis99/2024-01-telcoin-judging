# TokenId collision in `CouncilMember`, user A can claim user B's Telcoin balance

## Summary
A critical error of token Id collision in CouncilMember, the arrangement of tokenId is out of order .

## Vulnerability Detail
When GOVERNANCE_COUNCIL_ROLE `burn` a specfied tokenId's NFT in CouncilMember,  update the balance's to a new balance .

```solidity
  function burn(
        uint256 tokenId,
        address recipient
    ) external onlyRole(GOVERNANCE_COUNCIL_ROLE) {
        require(totalSupply() > 1, "CouncilMember: must maintain council");
        _retrieve();
        _withdrawAll(recipient, tokenId);

        uint256 balance = balances[balances.length - 1];
        balances[tokenId] = balance;
        balances.pop();
        _burn(tokenId);
    }
```

For example

TokenId
```markdown
0, 1, 2, 3, 4
```
balances
```markdown
[0, 10, 20, 30, 40]
```

After burn tokenId of 2, the tokenId 4 will take place of tokenId 2 .

TokenId
```markdown
0,1,3,4
```
balances
```markdown
[0, 10, 40, 30]
```

but at now , the owner of tokenId is not changed, and claim method still use array's id -> balance , so now tokenId's pre owner can claim current tokenId 4's 40 telcoin balance .

## Impact
Logic error,  user A can claim user B's Telcoin balance .

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/sablier/core/CouncilMember.sol#L210-L223

```solidity
function burn(
        uint256 tokenId,
        address recipient
    ) external onlyRole(GOVERNANCE_COUNCIL_ROLE) {
        require(totalSupply() > 1, "CouncilMember: must maintain council");
        _retrieve();
        _withdrawAll(recipient, tokenId);

        uint256 balance = balances[balances.length - 1];
        balances[tokenId] = balance;
        balances.pop();
        _burn(tokenId);
    }

```
Claim Token
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/sablier/core/CouncilMember.sol#L92C2-L105C11

```solidity
 function claim(uint256 tokenId, uint256 amount) external {
        // Ensure the function caller is the owner of the token (council member) they're trying to claim for
        require(
            _msgSender() == ownerOf(tokenId),
            "CouncilMember: caller is not council member holding this NFT index"
        );
        // Retrieve and distribute any pending TELCOIN for all council members
        _retrieve();

        // Ensure the requested amount doesn't exceed the balance of the council member
        require(
            amount <= balances[tokenId],
            "CouncilMember: withdrawal amount is higher than balance"
        );

```


## Tool used

Manual Review, Vscode

## Recommendation
Use mapping to store user's balance, array is not safe .
```solidity
 // current uncliamed members balances
  @-  uint256[] public balances;
  @+  mapping(uint256 => uint256) public balances;
```
