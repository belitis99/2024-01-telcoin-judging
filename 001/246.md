# Users balances are incorrectly swapped when a CouncilMember is burned

## Summary

When a `CouncilMember` is burned, their balance is set to the balance of the token at the end of the array. This causes users to have the incorrect balance.

## Vulnerability Detail

The balance of the tokenId being burned is set to the balance of the last, then it is popped. This causes the balance of the last tokenId to be incorrectly lost if the last NFT is not the one being burned.

## Impact

If the `CouncilMember` at the end of the array is not being burned, their balance will be lost and transferred to the position of a non existant NFT. The other user will lose any unclaimed rewards.

```solidity
function burn(
        uint256 tokenId,
        address recipient
    ) external onlyRole(GOVERNANCE_COUNCIL_ROLE) {
        require(totalSupply() > 1, "CouncilMember: must maintain council");
        _retrieve();
        _withdrawAll(recipient, tokenId);

        uint256 balance = balances[balances.length - 1];
        balances[tokenId] = balance;
        balances.pop();
        _burn(tokenId);
    }
```

## Recommendation

Change the burn function to only allow burning the last ID.
