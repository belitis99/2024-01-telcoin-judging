# CouncilMember:burn renders the contract inoperable after the first execution

## Summary
The CouncilMember contract suffers from a critical vulnerability that misaligns the balances array after a successful burn, rendering the contract inoperable.

## Vulnerability Detail

The root cause of the vulnerability is that the `burn` function incorrectly manages the `balances` array, shortening it by one each time an ERC721 token is burned while the latest minted NFT still withholds its unique `tokenId` which maps to the previous value of `balances.length`.
```solidity
// File: telcoin-audit/contracts/sablier/core/CouncilMember.sol
210:    function burn(
        ...
220:        balances.pop(); // <= FOUND: balances.length decreases, while latest minted nft withold its unique tokenId
221:        _burn(tokenId);
222:    }
```

This misalignment between existing `tokenIds` and the `balances` array results in several critical impacts:

1. Holders with tokenId greater than the length of balances cannot claim.
2. Subsequent burns of tokenId greater than balances length will revert.
3. Subsequent mint operations will revert due to tokenId collision. As `totalSupply` now collides with the existing `tokenId`.
```solidity
// File: telcoin-audit/contracts/sablier/core/CouncilMember.sol
173:    function mint(
        ...
179:
180:        balances.push(0);
181:        _mint(newMember, totalSupply());// <= FOUND
182:    }
```

This mismanagement creates a cascading effect, collectively rendering the contract inoperable. Following POC will demonstrate the issue more clearly in codes.

### POC

Run `git apply` on the following patch then run `npx hardhat test` to run the POC.

### Result 
>   CouncilMember
>     mutative
>       burn
>         Success
>           âœ” inoperable contract after burn (90ms)
>   1 passing (888ms)

The Passing execution of the POC confirmed that operations such as `claim`, `burn` & `mint` were all reverted which make the contract inoperable.

## Impact
The severity of the vulnerability is high due to the high likelihood of occurence and the critical impacts on the contract's operability and token holders' ability to interact with their assets.

## Recommendation
It is recommended to avoid popping out balances to keep alignment with uniquely minted tokenId. Alternatively, consider migrating to ERC1155, which inherently manages a built-in balance for each NFT.
