# Council members will claim 0 telcoin tokens as tokenid burn mechanism is wrong.

## Summary
When a tokenid is burned, the tokenid is not replaced properly with the last tokenid (balances array) that leads to claim no telcoin tokens to some council members.

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Let assume 10 tokenid(council members) are minted. Every (0 to 5) tokenid’s balance is 50e18 and every (6 to 9) tokenid’s balance is 100e18.
2. Now  GOVERNANCE_COUNCIL_ROLE wants to burn tokenid 4, so GOVERNANCE_COUNCIL_ROLE calls the function burn with param tokenid 4.
3. See the burn function, uint256 balance = balances[9] = 100e18;  balances[4] = 100(balance of tokenid 4 is updated to 100 and this is not replaced with last one); balances.pop() will remove tokenid 9 and then tokenid 4 is burned.
4. Tokenid  9 owner call the claim function to claim telcoin tokens but this will revert (see claim function) as  balances[tokenId] = 0(as there is no tokenindex/tokenid 9 in balances array, so default value is 0); so balances[tokenId] -= amount i.e (0 - amount) = underflow ,which ledas to revert.

## Impact
Council member can’t claim the telcoin tokens.
