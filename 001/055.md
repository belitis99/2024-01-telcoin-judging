# `CouncilMember::burn()` does not update states correctly leading to the loss of tokens to the council members.

## Summary

The vulnerability lies in the incorrect state update within the `CouncilMember::burn()` function, impacting the ability of council members to claim tokens from their balances after burning an NFT. The flaw arises when the last token's balance is shifted to the deleted token-ID, leaving the council member unable to claim tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

`CouncilMember::burn()` is used to burn the Council Member NFT by the address having `GOVERNANCE_COUNCIL_ROLE` role. But the state update in the burn function is not done correctly. In the function, first the balances of the tokens is retrieved from the stream and added to the balances of the each council member in `balances` array. Then it will transfer the tokens stored in the `balances` for the token-ID that will be burnt. After that it will just take the balance of the last token-ID and add it to the balance of deleted token-ID. And then NFT is burnt.

```solidity
    function burn(
        uint256 tokenId,
        address recipient
    ) external onlyRole(GOVERNANCE_COUNCIL_ROLE) {
        require(totalSupply() > 1, "CouncilMember: must maintain council");
        _retrieve();
        _withdrawAll(recipient, tokenId);

        uint256 balance = balances[balances.length - 1];
@>        balances[tokenId] = balance;
@>        balances.pop();
        _burn(tokenId);
    }
 ```

But this is where the problem occurs. As the balance of last owner is shifted to the balance of removed token-ID, the council member will not be able to claim the tokens as it is required to have the token-ID in order to claim the balance stored in it. But the token-ID is burnt so it will not be available and function will revert.
So now there are two possibilities, if there is no new council member added, the holder of last token-ID will not be able to claim his tokens. And if new council member is added, his balances will be claimed by the previous token-ID holder.

### Example
Let's take an example to understand it better. This example exactly demonstrates the working of the below given test for the PoC:

* Let's say Governance council decides to add 3 council members in the beginning. And the Stablier stream is streaming tokens at the rate of `100` per second. This situation can be demonstrated like this:
    - Note it is assumed here the call to every corresponding mint is done after 1 second.
    - After first call to `mint()` no distribution of tokens will be done:
     
      |                     |   0   |
      |---------------------|-------|
      | tokenIDs            |   0   |
      | balances            |  0  |


    - After second call to `mint()`. 100 tokens will be distributed to old token-IDs:
      |                     |   0   |   1   |
      |---------------------|-------|-------|
      | tokenIDs            |   0   |   1   |
      | balances            |  100  |  0   |

    - After third call to `mint()`. 100 tokens will be distributed to old token-IDs (50 token each):
      |                     |   0   |   1   |   2   |
      |---------------------|-------|-------|-------|
      | tokenIDs            |   0   |   1   |   2   |
      | balances            |  150  |  50   |   0   |
      
* Now governance council decides to burn the token-ID `1`. Again 100 tokens will be distributed to old token-IDs. Now to look at the issue properly, let's look at how the `burn()` call will update the states: 
  - First the `_retrieve()` will be called, this will transfer 100 tokens to the old token-IDs (33 each):
      |                     |   0   |   1   |   2   |
      |---------------------|-------|-------|-------|
      | tokenIDs            |   0   |   1   |   2   |
      | balances            |  183  |  83   |   33   |

  - Then `_withdrawAll` will be called that will transfer the balance of token-ID `1` to the receiver. New balances will be this:
      |                     |   0   |   1   |   2   |
      |---------------------|-------|-------|-------|
      | tokenIDs            |   0   |   1   |   2   |
      | balances            |  183  |  0   |   33   |
 
  - Then balance of last token id will be transferred to the deleted token-ID:
      |                     |   0   |   1   |   2   |
      |---------------------|-------|-------|-------|
      | tokenIDs            |   0   |   1   |   2   |
      | balances            |  183  |  33   |   0   |

  - Then the token-ID `1` will be burnt and last value from the `balances` array will be popped:
        |                     |   0   |   1   |
      |---------------------|-------|-------|
      | tokenIDs            |   0   |   1 (Burnt)   |
      | balances            |  183  |  33   |
  
* As we can see from above table the balance of token-ID `2` holder is stored at index of `1` in `balances` array. Now the council member having token-ID `2` tries to claim his balance using the following parameters: 
  ```javascript
    claim({tokenId: 2, amount: 33});
  ```
  But the call will revert as there is nothing stored at index `2` in the `balances` array.
* So the council member tries to call the function with token-ID `1` where his balances is transferred in `balances` array:
  ```javascript
    claim({tokenId: 1, amount: 33});
  ```
  But this function call will revert as well since it is required in the `claim` function that Message sender should have the token-ID (see [this](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/sablier/core/CouncilMember.sol#L94C1-L97C11)) which is not possible as the token-ID `1` is burnt and council member is the owner of token-ID `2`.

## Impact

Council members are unable to claim their balances, as the state update in `CouncilMember::burn()` renders the balance inaccessible.

## Code Snippet

### Here is a test for PoC:
Add the below given test in this [block](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/test/sablier/CouncilMember.test.ts#L165) of `CouncilMember.test.ts` file 

```javascript
            it("burn will not update the states correctly", async () => {
                // minting 3 council members NFTs
                await expect(councilMember.mint(councilMember1.address)).to.not.reverted;
                await expect(councilMember.mint(councilMember2.address)).to.not.reverted;
                await expect(councilMember.mint(councilMember3.address)).to.not.reverted;

                // getting the balance of the councilMember contract
                // should be 200 since in the beginning tokenSupply was 0, so nothing was retrieved
                expect(await telcoin.balanceOf(await councilMember.getAddress())).to.equal(200);

                // burning the NFT of the councilMember at index 1
                await expect(councilMember.burn(1, holder.address)).to.not.reverted;

                // getting the balance of the councilMember contract
                // should be 217 since the council member at 1 had 83 TEL and it has been transferred to him
                expect(await telcoin.balanceOf(await councilMember.getAddress())).to.equal(217);
                
                // holder should have 83 TEL
                expect(await telcoin.balanceOf(holder.address)).to.equal(83);

                ////////////////////////////
                //  Council Member 0     ///
                ////////////////////////////

                // first mint = 0 TEL
                // second mint = 100 TEL
                // third mint = 50 TEL
                // burn = 33 TEL
                // total = 183 TEL
                expect(await councilMember.balances(0)).to.equal(183);

                ////////////////////////////
                // Council Member 1     ///
                ////////////////////////////

                // since council member having tokenId 1 was burned, the last council member will take its place. 
                // so tokenId 1 will get the balance of tokenId 2. And the balance of tokenId 2 will be deleted.
                // first mint = 0 TEL
                // second mint = 0 TEL
                // burn = 33 TEL
                // total = 33 TEL
                expect(await councilMember.balances(1)).to.equal(33);

                // council member 3 should be the owner of token Id 2. And the owner of token Id can claim his tokens associated
                // with that tokenId. So council member 3 should be able to claim 33 TEL
                expect(await councilMember.ownerOf(2)).to.equal(councilMember3.address);

                // council member 3 tries to claim his tokens but will revert
                await expect(councilMember.connect(councilMember3).claim(2, 33)).to.be.reverted

                // council member 3 tries to claim his shifted balance at tokenId 1 but will revert as well
                await expect(councilMember.connect(councilMember3).claim(1, 33)).to.be.reverted
            });
```

Also update the following lines in the file to this:

```diff
File:  CouncilMember.test.ts

- 21        [admin, support, member, holder, target] = await ethers.getSigners();
+ 21        [admin, support, member, holder, target, councilMember1, councilMember2, councilMember3] = await ethers.getSigners();   
```

GitHub: [21](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/test/sablier/CouncilMember.test.ts#L21)

```diff

+ 15    let councilMember1: SignerWithAddress;
+ 16    let councilMember2: SignerWithAddress;
+ 17    let councilMember3: SignerWithAddress;
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

In this scenario, it is advisable to utilize a more suitable data structure than an array or explore alternative methods to update balances. Relying solely on the `balances` array for the current system may not be optimal. A suggested solution involves creating an additional mapping to track the ownership of users corresponding to an index in the balances array.

> NOTE
> The following updates are presented for some of the functions. Implement these changes across all affected functions if opting for this solution.

Maintain the existing structure but introduce a new mapping to monitor the ownership of users in relation to their corresponding index in the `balances` array.

_mint:_

```diff
+    mapping(address tokenOwner => uint256 index) public tokenOwnerBalancesIndex;
    function mint(
        address newMember
    ) external onlyRole(GOVERNANCE_COUNCIL_ROLE) {
        if (totalSupply() != 0) {
            _retrieve();
        }

        balances.push(0);
+        tokenOwnerBalancesIndex[newMember] = totalSupply();
        _mint(newMember, totalSupply());
    }
```

_burn:_

```diff
    function burn(
        uint256 tokenId,
        address recipient
    ) external onlyRole(GOVERNANCE_COUNCIL_ROLE) {
        require(totalSupply() > 1, "CouncilMember: must maintain council");
        _retrieve();
        _withdrawAll(recipient, tokenId);

        uint256 balance = balances[balances.length - 1];
+        address lastOwner = ownerOf(balances.length - 1);
        balances[tokenId] = balance;
        balances.pop();

+        tokenOwnerBalancesIndex[lastOwner] = tokenId;
        _burn(tokenId);
    }
```

_claim:_

```diff
    function claim(uint256 tokenId, uint256 amount) external {
        // Ensure the function caller is the owner of the token (council member) they're trying to claim for
        require(
 -           _msgSender() == ownerOf(tokenId),
+            _msgSender() == ownerOf(tokenId) || tokenOwnerBalancesIndex[msg.sender] == tokenId,
            "CouncilMember: caller is not council member holding this NFT index"
        );
        // Retrieve and distribute any pending TELCOIN for all council members
        _retrieve();

        // Ensure the requested amount doesn't exceed the balance of the council member
        require(
            amount <= balances[tokenId],
            "CouncilMember: withdrawal amount is higher than balance"
        );

        // Deduct the claimed amount from the token's balance
        balances[tokenId] -= amount;
        // Safely transfer the claimed amount of TELCOIN to the function caller
        TELCOIN.safeTransfer(_msgSender(), amount);
    }
```
