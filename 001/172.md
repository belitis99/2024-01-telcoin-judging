# Minting to users using `totalSupply()` as the NFT ID is incorrect

## Summary
In the `mint()` function, the protocol uses `totalSupply()` as the NFT ID to mint to the user. However, during a burn, `totalSupply()` decreases, causing the wrong NFT ID to be minted to the user.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `mint()` function, the protocol mints an NFT with the latest value of `totalSupply()` as the NFT ID and assigns it to the `newMember`. However, during a burn operation, where `totalSupply()` decreases, it results in transferring an NFT with an owner to another person, subsequently transferring the associated rewards as well.
```solidity
    function mint(
        address newMember
    ) external onlyRole(GOVERNANCE_COUNCIL_ROLE) {
        if (totalSupply() != 0) {
            _retrieve();
        }

        balances.push(0);
        _mint(newMember, totalSupply());
    }

```

## Impact
Transferring an existing NFT to another person also results in transferring the associated rewards to that person.
