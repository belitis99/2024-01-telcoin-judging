# mint() function using totalSupply() as the id for newly minted NFT will always be reverted if some NFTs were burnt

## Summary
In [mint()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/sablier/core/CouncilMember.sol#L173), the function use totalSupply() as the id for the future minted token, but not beware of the case if some of the NFTs were burnt affecting totalSupply().

## Vulnerability Detail
If some NFTs were burnt, the totalSupply() will decrease and make the Id duplicate with the other NFTs that were minted before.

POC:
1. protocol minted 3 NFTs, totalSupply() is now 3
2. protocol burned the NFTs of id 1
3. totalSupply() is now 2
4. protocol minted a new NFTs, Id now would be 2 as the totalSupply() is 2
5. mint() function will be always reverted as NFT with Id 2 already exists

## Impact
Protocol can't mint new NFT forever as it would duplicate the existed NFT
