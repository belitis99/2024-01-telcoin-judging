# Wrong logic on minting using `totalSupply` as tokenId can cause minting DoSed

## Summary

The mint logic is flawed, due to minting a token using `totalSupply()`.
when `burn` a tokenId, it will remove the tokenId, and the length (total supply) is now decreased by 1 from previous `totalSupply`. Therefore, when minting a new one, it will mint a tokenId which already exist.

## Vulnerability Detail

In CouncilMember mint function, the `_mint` is using `totalSupply()` as value for the tokenId instead of common variable increment.

This can cause issue because when there was a tokenId being burned, which then decreasing the `totalSupply()` then the next minting it will use the already existing tokenId.

For example if there are 5 tokenId: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, `totalSupply()` is 5
then next mint would be minting this tokenId 5.

But, then before minting again, a user or owner burn tokenId #2 thus
the tokens would be: 0, 1, 3, 4 and `totalSupply()` is now 4

Now, the next mint, which by the code provided will be `totalSupply()` as the tokenId, which is 4, will be reverted due to it's already exist.

```js
File: CouncilMember.sol
173:     function mint(
174:         address newMember
175:     ) external onlyRole(GOVERNANCE_COUNCIL_ROLE) {
176:         if (totalSupply() != 0) {
177:             _retrieve();
178:         }
179:
180:         balances.push(0);
181:         _mint(newMember, totalSupply());
182:     }
```

## Impact

Unable to mint new tokenId, breaking the contract

## Recommendation

Consider to use a common incremental value for tokenId
