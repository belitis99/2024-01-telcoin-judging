# Burning of a member NFT stops further minting of member NFT

## Summary
Once a member NFT from middle is burned, it further stops the minting of member NFT as `councilMember::mint` is using `totalSupply()` as next tokenId

## Vulnerability Detail
`councilMember::mint` is using `totalSupply()` as next tokenId parameter, which can vary because of burning of member NFT and if that happens it'll stop further minting of NFT as that tokenId will be already minted
```solidity
  function mint(
        address newMember
    ) external onlyRole(GOVERNANCE_COUNCIL_ROLE) {
        if (totalSupply() != 0) {
            _retrieve();
        }

        balances.push(0);
   @>     _mint(newMember, totalSupply());
    }
```

How this works:-
1. councilMember minted 5 NFTs[0,1,2,3,4] to members ie totalSupply = 5
2. it burned tokenId = 2 [0,1,3,4] ie totalSupply = 4
3. Now if councilMember mints next member then tokenId will be 4(as totalSupply = 4) but tokenId 4 is already minted, it will revert

// Here is the POC
```solidity
 it("Further stops minting of NFT", async () => {
        // for testing only taking 3 NFT[0,1,2]
        await expect(councilMember.mint(member.address)).to.not.reverted;
        await expect(councilMember.mint(support.address)).to.not.reverted;
        await expect(councilMember.mint(await councilMember.getAddress())).to
          .not.reverted;
        // Total supply = 3
        await expect(await councilMember.totalSupply()).to.be.equal(3);

        // Buring tokenId = 1
        await expect(councilMember.burn(1, holder.address)).to.not.reverted;
        // totalsupply = 2
        await expect(await councilMember.totalSupply()).to.be.equal(2);
        // reverting the mint to member
        await expect(councilMember.mint(member.address)).to.be.reverted;
        //Again totalSupply = 2
        await expect(await councilMember.totalSupply()).to.be.equal(2);
      });
```
## Impact
Stops further minting of member NFT

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use a incrementing counter instead of totalSupply for next tokenId
