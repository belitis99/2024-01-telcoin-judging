# Council Member NFT Would Be Lost If New Council Member Contract Does Not Implement onERC721Received

## Summary

Council Member NFT Would Be Lost If New Council Member Contract Does Not Implement onERC721Received , this is because a plain transfer is performed to transfer the council member nft to the receiver . 

## Vulnerability Detail

1.) The function `removeFromOffice` in the CouncilMember.sol contract replaces an existing council member with a new one and withdraws the old member's TELCOIN allocation

2.) It withdraws the balance of that tokenId and sends it to a receiver and then the NFT is sent to the `to` address at L133

` _transfer(from, to, tokenId);`

3.) This is a plain transfer , meaning if the `to` address (most probably a contract as confirmed by the sponsor) does not 
implement a `onERC721Received` then the NFT transfer would lock up the nft at the `to` address and would be impossible 
to retrieve.
