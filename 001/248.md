# Latest council member will lost rewards after burning council member NFT

## Summary
After burning council member NFT, latest user in council member list will lost rewards due to updating of `balances` array

## Vulnerability Detail
Function `burn()` is used to burn council member NFT:

    function burn(
        uint256 tokenId,
        address recipient
    ) external onlyRole(GOVERNANCE_COUNCIL_ROLE) {
        require(totalSupply() > 1, "CouncilMember: must maintain council");
        _retrieve();
        _withdrawAll(recipient, tokenId);

        uint256 balance = balances[balances.length - 1];
        balances[tokenId] = balance;
        balances.pop();
        _burn(tokenId);
    }

Consider scenario:
1, User A, B, C, D are council members and have tokenId= 0, 1, 2, 3.
2, User B's NFT is burned, balance of user D, which is balances[3] is set to balances[1].
3, User D are not able to claim rewards because there is no token left in balances[3].

## Impact
