# Malicious council member can't be removed

## Summary
Malicious council member can't be removed from council member list by transfer ERC721 token to other address

## Vulnerability Detail
Function `removeFromOffice` is called by governance to replace existing council member with a new one and withdraw old telecoin:

    function removeFromOffice(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 tokenId,
        address rewardRecipient
    ) external onlyRole(GOVERNANCE_COUNCIL_ROLE) {
        // Retrieve and distribute any pending TELCOIN for all council members
        _retrieve();
        // Withdraw all the TELCOIN rewards for the specified token to the rewardRecipient
        _withdrawAll(rewardRecipient, tokenId);
        // Transfer the token (representing the council membership) from one address to another
        _transfer(from, to, tokenId);    // <---
    }

it call `_transfer()` function in ERC721Upgradeable library to transfer ownership of token:

    function _transfer(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId) internal {
        if (to == address(0)) {
            revert ERC721InvalidReceiver(address(0));
        }
        address previousOwner = _update(to, tokenId, address(0));
        if (previousOwner == address(0)) {
            revert ERC721NonexistentToken(tokenId);
        } else if (previousOwner != from) {
            revert ERC721IncorrectOwner(from, tokenId, previousOwner);
        }
    }

But `transferFrom()` function in the `ERC721Upgradeable` is not overriden, which make user able to transfer token to other address, which make condition `else if (previousOwner != from)` is true, lead to contract become revert.
`transferFrom()` function:

    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId) public virtual {
        if (to == address(0)) {
            revert ERC721InvalidReceiver(address(0));
        }
        // Setting an "auth" arguments enables the `_isAuthorized` check which verifies that the token exists
        // (from != 0). Therefore, it is not needed to verify that the return value is not 0 here.
        address previousOwner = _update(to, tokenId, _msgSender());
        if (previousOwner != from) {
            revert ERC721IncorrectOwner(from, tokenId, previousOwner);
        }
    }

Council member can transfer token because they are owner of token that granted in the `mint() function:

    function mint(
        address newMember
    ) external onlyRole(GOVERNANCE_COUNCIL_ROLE) {
        if (totalSupply() != 0) {
            _retrieve();
        }

        balances.push(0);
        _mint(newMember, totalSupply());
    }

## Impact
Council member can't be removed. Attacker can execute bad actions like cancel any transaction by challenging them.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
`transferFrom()` function in the `ERC721Upgradeable` contract should be overriden to not allowing anyone to call them
