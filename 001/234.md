# Incorrect balance is removed when burning

## Summary

The balance of the last tokenId minted is removed when burning any token.

## Vulnerability Detail

When minting a new council member nft, the `balances` array is increased and the tokenId of the nft is directly tied to the index of the balances array. When a token is burned the balance of the tokenId is set to the last balance in balances and the last balance is removed, decreasing the length of the balances array.

When the owner of the last token wants to claim, an index out of bounds error will be thrown since the balances array was reduced and the index/tokenId is no longer valid.

## Impact

Council members may lose their allocated TELCOINs if nfts are burned.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Balances should not be removed, the length must be the same as the totalSupply. Since `_withdrawAll` is called in `burn`, the balance of the removed token is already set to 0 so removing from `balances` is not necessary. Alternatively, consider using a mapping instead of an array to keep track of balances.
