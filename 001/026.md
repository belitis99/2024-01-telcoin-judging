# CouncilMember::burn is not correctly implemented

## Summary
CouncilMember#burn is not correctly implemented and due to it, a council member will be removed suddenly.

## Vulnerability Detail
Let's say there are 2 members, it means now the `balances` array includes 2 items which are listed below (i have named the items for easier explanation):
- balances[0] = Bob = 100 tokens (just an example amount)
- balances[1] = Jack = 250 tokens (just an example amount)

Now the governance decides to burn the `Bob`'s NFT (removing Bob's NFT means removing Bob from the council members), so they call `burn`:
```solidity
function burn(
        uint256 tokenId,
        address recipient
    ) external onlyRole(GOVERNANCE_COUNCIL_ROLE) {
        require(totalSupply() > 1, "CouncilMember: must maintain council");
        _retrieve();
        _withdrawAll(recipient, tokenId);

        uint256 balance = balances[balances.length - 1];
        balances[tokenId] = balance;
        balances.pop(); // @audit due to pop(), the User2 will be removed from the `balances` array
        _burn(tokenId);
    }
```
Now `tokenId = 0` (because the Bob is the first NFT, so tokenId of Bob is 0) and `recipient = Bob`

The `_retrieve` function re-balances the balance of all members and then the `_withdrawAll` transfers all the `Bob`'s balance to him.

Then comes here:
```solidity
        uint256 balance = balances[balances.length - 1]; // <--- balance = Jack's balance = 250 tokens
        balances[tokenId] = balance; // <--- balances[0] = 250 tokens 
        balances.pop(); // <--- removes Jack from the list -> Now balances[1] doesn't exist and can't be accessible anymore
        _burn(tokenId); // burning the Bob's NFT -> ownerOf(tokenId) = ownerOf(0) = address(0)
```
And we see Jack is removed from the members, the Jack's balance is moved to Bob's position in the array, but the ownership of Bob's NFT is not transferred to Jack.

Jack calls `claim`:
```solidity
function claim(uint256 tokenId, uint256 amount) external {
        // Ensure the function caller is the owner of the token (council member) they're trying to claim for
        require(
            _msgSender() == ownerOf(tokenId),
            "CouncilMember: caller is not council member holding this NFT index"
        );
        // Retrieve and distribute any pending TELCOIN for all council members
        _retrieve();

        // Ensure the requested amount doesn't exceed the balance of the council member
        require(
            amount <= balances[tokenId],
            "CouncilMember: withdrawal amount is higher than balance"
        );

        // Deduct the claimed amount from the token's balance
        balances[tokenId] -= amount;
        // Safely transfer the claimed amount of TELCOIN to the function caller
        TELCOIN.safeTransfer(_msgSender(), amount);
    }
```
Now:
- If he enters `tokenId = 0`, then because of ownerOf(0) is equal to `address(0)` so it reverts.
- If he enters `tokenId = 1`, then again he gets another revert -> because balances[1] doesn't exist in array and can't be accessible.
## Impact

The last council member will be removed suddenly and won't be able to claim .

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
While burning:
- Jack's balance should be moved to Bob's position/index in the `balances` array. (This is OK)
- The ownership of Bob's NFT should be transferred to Jack.
- The ownership of Jack's previous NFT should be transferred to address(0).
