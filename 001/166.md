# Incorrect Balance Assignment When Burning Non-Sequential Tokens in `CouncilMember::burn`

## Summary
The `burn()` function in the CouncilMember contract contains logic that incorrectly assigns the balance of the last token to any token being burned. This leads to incorrect balances when burning non-sequential tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `burn()` function calls `_withdrawAll()` to send the balance of the burned token to the target address. It then does:
```solidity
uint256 balance = balances[balances.length - 1];
balances[tokenId] = balance;
```
This takes the balance of the last token and assigns it to the token being burned. If the token being burned is not the last in the enumeration order, it will replace the correct balance with the balance of the last token.

## Impact
This will directly affect the balances mapping, leading to incorrect balances being reflected for users. When non-sequential tokens are burned, their balances will be overwritten with the balance of the last token.

For example, if there are 3 tokens with balances 100, 200, 300 respectively. Burning token 1 would replace its balance of 100 with the balance of the last token, 300.


## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/sablier/core/CouncilMember.sol#L210-L222

## Proof of Concept
Let's assume:

-   Alice has token 1 with balance 100
-   Bob has token 2 with balance 200
-   Eve has token 3 with balance 300

If Bob's token 2 is burned:
```solidity
burn(2, bobAddress);
```
This will replace token 2's balance with Eve's token balance:
```solidity
balances[2] = balances[balances.length - 1] = 300;
```
Now the balances mapping will be: Alice: 100 Bob: 300 Eve: 300

Clearly incorrect since Bob's original balance was 200.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The balance assignment logic should be fixed to explicitly zero-out the balance for the burned `tokenId`:
```solidity
function burn(uint256 tokenId, address recipient) external {
  // ...
  balances[tokenId] = 0;
  // ...
}
```
