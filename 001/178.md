# The removeFromOffice() function is implemented incorrectly

## Summary
In the `removeFromOffice()` function,it does not clear the approval, allowing the approved user to retain permission for operations.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `removeFromOffice()` function, the protocol transfers the NFT from the from address to the to address. 
```solidity
 function removeFromOffice(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 tokenId,
        address rewardRecipient
    ) external onlyRole(GOVERNANCE_COUNCIL_ROLE) {
        // Retrieve and distribute any pending TELCOIN for all council members
        _retrieve();
        // Withdraw all the TELCOIN rewards for the specified token to the rewardRecipient
        _withdrawAll(rewardRecipient, tokenId);
        // Transfer the token (representing the council membership) from one address to another
        _transfer(from, to, tokenId);
    }

```
However, if this NFT was previously approved to another user, this function does not clear the approval, allowing the approved user to retain permission for operations.
```solidity
 function approve(
        address to,
        uint256 tokenId
    )
        public
        override(ERC721Upgradeable, IERC721)
        onlyRole(GOVERNANCE_COUNCIL_ROLE)
    {
        _tokenApproval[tokenId] = to;
        emit Approval(ERC721Upgradeable.ownerOf(tokenId), to, tokenId);
    }

```

## Impact
After the NFT has changed ownership, the person who was previously approved still retains permission to operate on it.
