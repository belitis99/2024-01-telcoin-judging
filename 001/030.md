# Burning CouncilMember NFTs locks the last minter from their balance

## Summary

The `CouncilMember::burn()` method deletes the accumulated `TELCOIN` balance from storage array `balances` at a given index. This deletion alters the length of the `balances` array, decreasing it by one. Due to the fact that `CouncilMember` token IDs are used to look up a holders' balances in the array, this operation effectively locks the owner of the last minted NFT from their balance.

## Vulnerability Detail

The storage array `uint256[] public balances` contains the accumulated balances of `TELCOIN` tokens which can be claimed by the `CouncilMember` NFT holders. Inside the `CouncilMember::claim()` method, the `CouncilMember` token id is used to look up a specific balance in the array, as one can see in the code snippet below:

```javascript
    /**
     * @notice Allows council members to claim their allocated amounts of TELCOIN
     * @dev Checks if the caller is the owner of the provided tokenId and if the requested amount is available.
     * @param tokenId The NFT index associated with a council member.
     * @param amount Amount of TELCOIN the council member wants to withdraw.
     */
    function claim(uint256 tokenId, uint256 amount) external {
        // Ensure the function caller is the owner of the token (council member) they're trying to claim for
        require(
            _msgSender() == ownerOf(tokenId),
            "CouncilMember: caller is not council member holding this NFT index"
        );
        // Retrieve and distribute any pending TELCOIN for all council members
        _retrieve();

        // Ensure the requested amount doesn't exceed the balance of the council member
        require(
            amount <= balances[tokenId],
            "CouncilMember: withdrawal amount is higher than balance"
        );

        // Deduct the claimed amount from the token's balance
        balances[tokenId] -= amount;
        // Safely transfer the claimed amount of TELCOIN to the function caller
        TELCOIN.safeTransfer(_msgSender(), amount);
   }
```

The correct behavior of this method requires the token ID always to point to the corresponding balance in the `balances` array. This requirement is breached in the `CouncilMember::burn()` method.

```javascript
/**
     * @notice Burn a council member NFT
     * @dev The function retrieves and distributes TELCOIN before burning the NFT.
     * @dev Restricted to the GOVERNANCE_COUNCIL_ROLE.
     * @param tokenId Token ID of the council member NFT to be burned.
     * @param recipient Address to receive the burned NFT holder's TELCOIN allocation.
     */
    function burn(
        uint256 tokenId,
        address recipient
    ) external onlyRole(GOVERNANCE_COUNCIL_ROLE) {
        require(totalSupply() > 1, "CouncilMember: must maintain council");
        _retrieve();
        _withdrawAll(recipient, tokenId);

        uint256 balance = balances[balances.length - 1];
        balances[tokenId] = balance;
        balances.pop(); //@audit H1 - Wrong balance tracking! Indexes in balance can change
        _burn(tokenId);
    }
```

Before burning the NFT, the `burn()` method deletes the balance corresponding to the token ID. The length-altering delete is performed - the last element of the array is copied to the deleted index, and then the last element gets popped.

Let's consider the following scenario:

1.  4 NFT's are minted. Alice gets token ID 0, Bob - 1, Charlie - 2, and Dylan - 3. The `balances` array can be visualized like this: `[alicesBalance, bobsBalance, charliesBalance, dylansBalance]`
2.  Bob's NFT gets burned and his balance deleted. The `balances` array after the `burn()` method execution can be visualized like this: `[alicesBalance, dylansBalance, charliesBalance]`
3.  Dylan wants to claim his `TELCOINs`. However, since his NFT has id 3, the `claim()` method will try to access his balance at `balances[3]`. This element does not exist in the altered array, therefore the call will revert. Dylan will be effectively locked from their balance forever.

The POC for the issue is proposed below. Please paste it into `CouncilMember.test.ts` test suite.

```javascript
describe("POC", () => {
            it("Burning any NFT locks the last NFT owner from their balance", async () =>
            {
                /* 1. Mint the NFTs for 4 users */
                await expect(councilMember.mint(member.address)).to.not.reverted;
                await expect(councilMember.mint(support.address)).to.not.reverted;
                await expect(councilMember.mint(holder.address)).to.not.reverted;
                await expect(councilMember.mint(target.address)).to.not.reverted;
                /* 2. Verify initial NFT ownership */
                expect(await councilMember.ownerOf(0)).to.equal(member.address);
                expect(await councilMember.ownerOf(1)).to.equal(support.address);
                expect(await councilMember.ownerOf(2)).to.equal(holder.address);
                expect(await councilMember.ownerOf(3)).to.equal(target.address);
                /* 3. Distribute TELCOINS between members*/
                await councilMember.retrieve();
                /* 4. Verify starting balances */                
                expect(await councilMember.balances(0)).to.equal(208);
                expect(await councilMember.balances(1)).to.equal(108);
                expect(await councilMember.balances(2)).to.equal(58);
                expect(await councilMember.balances(3)).to.equal(25); 
                /* 5. User "support" burns their NFT - ID 1 */
                await councilMember.burn(1, support.address);
                /* 6. User "target" can't claim their TELCOINs anymore, as its balance was deleted */
                await expect(councilMember.connect(target).claim(3, 25)).to.be.reverted; 
                
            })
})
```

## Impact

High, as the user gets locked from their tokens.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The length of the `balances` array should not be altered in the `CouncilMember::burn()` method.

```diff
function burn(
        uint256 tokenId,
        address recipient
    ) external onlyRole(GOVERNANCE_COUNCIL_ROLE) {
        require(totalSupply() > 1, "CouncilMember: must maintain council");
        _retrieve();
        _withdrawAll(recipient, tokenId);

-        uint256 balance = balances[balances.length - 1];
-        balances[tokenId] = balance;
-        balances.pop(); //@audit H1 - Wrong balance tracking! Indexes in balance can change
+        delete balances[tokenId];	
        _burn(tokenId);
    }
```

The `CouncilMember::retrieve()` method has to be adjusted, so that it won't distribute `TELCOINs` to balances corresponsing to burned NFTs:

```diff
// Add the individual balance to each council member's balance
for (uint i = 0; i < balances.length; i++) {
+	if(this.ownerOf(i) != address(0)) {
        balances[i] += individualBalance;
+	}
}
```
