# The last council member cannot claim his allocated TELCOIN after someone's token is burnt.

## Summary
When burning a token, the last council member lost his balance, and cannot claim his allocated TELCOIN.

## Vulnerability Detail
When burning a target `tokenId`, the `balances` of that `tokenId` will be cleared. It will be set to 0 in `_withdrawAll`, this is fine. But the `tokenId` is then poped from the `balances` array in the `burn()` function. Actually it is the last `tokenId` is poped, and the last `tokenId`'s balance is set to the target `tokenId`.  This creates a problem that the last `tokenId`'s owner will lost his balance in `balances` array, and will not be able to claim his allocated TELCOIN.

213:    ) external onlyRole(GOVERNANCE_COUNCIL_ROLE) {
214:        require(totalSupply() > 1, "CouncilMember: must maintain council");
215:        _retrieve();
216:        _withdrawAll(recipient, tokenId);
217:
218:->      uint256 balance = balances[balances.length - 1];
219:->      balances[tokenId] = balance;
220:->      balances.pop();
221:        _burn(tokenId);
222:    }

POC: The following test case can show the problem. Add the test case to `CouncilMember.test.ts#CouncilMember.tokenomics` and run it.
```typescript
        describe.only("claim_after_burn", () => {
            it("claim after burn revert", async () => {
                // init the addresses of member0, member1, member2 in `beforeEach`

                // mint: token0 for member0, token1 for member1, token2 for member2
                await expect(councilMember.mint(member0.address)).to.not.reverted;
                await expect(councilMember.mint(member1.address)).to.not.reverted;
                await expect(councilMember.mint(member2.address)).to.not.reverted;
                expect(await telcoin.balanceOf(await councilMember.getAddress())).to.equal(200);

                await expect(councilMember.burn(1, holder.address)).to.not.reverted;
                
                console.log("balance 0: ", await councilMember.balances(0));
                console.log("balance 1: ", await councilMember.balances(1));

                expect(await councilMember.ownerOf(2)).to.be.equal(await member2.address);

                // councilMember.balances.length is 2, claim id 2 will be reverted as out-of-bounds
                await expect(councilMember.connect(member2).claim(2, 1)).to.be.reverted;
            });
        });
```
The result of the test case is:
```typescript
  CouncilMember
    tokenomics
      claim_after_burn
balance 0:  183n
balance 1:  33n
        âœ” claim after burn revert (266ms)
```

## Impact
The last council member cannot claim his allocated TELCOIN after some other `tokenId` is burnt.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Do not pop `tokenId` from `balances` arrary while burning, i.e. remove the lines of CouncilMember.sol#L218-L220.

210:    function burn(
211:        uint256 tokenId,
212:        address recipient
213:    ) external onlyRole(GOVERNANCE_COUNCIL_ROLE) {
214:        require(totalSupply() > 1, "CouncilMember: must maintain council");
215:        _retrieve();
216:        _withdrawAll(recipient, tokenId);
217:
218:->      uint256 balance = balances[balances.length - 1];
219:->      balances[tokenId] = balance;
220:->      balances.pop();
221:        _burn(tokenId);
222:    }
