# Incomplete Access Control in initialize Function

## Summary
The initialize function in the StakingRewardsManager contract lacks a thorough access control check, potentially allowing unauthorized users to call the function. This could lead to unexpected behavior and compromise the security of the contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
The initialize function uses the hasRole function to check if the caller has the DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE. However, after the check, the function proceeds to grant the DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE to the caller using _grantRole. This sequence of actions leaves a window where a malicious actor could exploit the lack of a proper access control check.
## Impact

Consider a scenario where the StakingRewardsManager contract is deployed, and the initialize function is not securely implemented. An attacker, aware of this vulnerability, exploits it by calling the initialize function with their own address, allowing them to gain unauthorized admin privileges.

**Unauthorized Admin Access:**

The attacker successfully calls the initialize function with their address.
The function, lacking a proper access control check, grants DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE to the attacker using _grantRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, _msgSender()).

**Manipulation of Staking Contracts:**

As an unauthorized admin, the attacker gains control over the StakingRewardsManager contract and its associated StakingRewards contracts.
The attacker can now modify the configurations, rewards, or even remove existing staking contracts, leading to financial losses for legitimate users.

**Insecurity of Funds:**

The attacker, having admin privileges, may attempt to recover ERC20 tokens from StakingRewards contracts or manipulate the reward distribution process.
This can result in the loss of funds, disrupt the intended functionality of the contracts, and erode user trust in the system.

**Reputation Damage:**

The compromise of the StakingRewardsManager contract's security can lead to a loss of reputation for the project and its developers.
Users may lose confidence in the platform, affecting adoption rates and the overall success of the project.

**Legal Consequences:**

Depending on the severity of the unauthorized access and its impact on users, the project may face legal consequences.
Regulatory bodies may intervene, imposing fines or taking legal action against the project and its developers.

In summary, the impact of this vulnerability goes beyond the immediate manipulation of contract functionality, extending to financial losses, damage to reputation, and potential legal ramifications for the project and its stakeholders. It underscores the critical importance of implementing robust access controls to safeguard smart contracts and their users.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
```solidity
function initialize(
    IERC20 reward,
    StakingRewardsFactory factory
) external initializer {
    require(hasRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, _msgSender()), "Caller is not an admin");
    require(address(factory) != address(0) && address(reward) != address(0), "StakingRewardsManager: cannot initialize to zero");
    
    // Revoke the admin role from the caller immediately after the check
    renounceRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, _msgSender());

    // set values
    rewardToken = reward;
    stakingRewardsFactory = factory;
    emit StakingRewardsFactoryChanged(factory);
}
```
