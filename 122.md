# The First CouncilNFT holder can drain all the tokens from sablier

## Summary
The First CouncilNFT holder can drain all the tokens from sablier



## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol is supposed to send tokens to the Sablier stream before the minting of the councilMember NFT occurs. If this step is not completed, minting will throw an error with ERC20: InsufficientBalance due to a balance of 0 in the Sablier _target address.

In this scenario, if the NFT is minted individually then, the first NFT holder can call retrieve multiple times increasing its TEL balance and draining the streaming funds.

Steps
protocol send 1000 TEL to sablier stream
mint councilMember NFT to user- A
user - A calls retrieve multiple times frontrunning all other mint transactions
balances[0] = 1000 TEL
## Impact
Initial members can drain all the streaming funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The rewards should be streamed per second bases rather than streaming when retrieve is called.
