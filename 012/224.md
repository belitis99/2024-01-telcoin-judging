# ERC-165 is not implemented correctly in CouncilMember

## Summary

ERC-165 is implemented incorrectly, since rather than call the supportsInterface methods on the parent classes, it directly checks for either of their interfaceIds.

## Vulnerability Detail

ERC-165 specifies a `supportsInterface` method to check whether a contract implements a known standard interface using a bytes4 value corresponding to a known interface. Commonly used interfaces such as ERC721 and AccessControl are examples of contracts often used with ERC-165. The implementation of `supportsInterface` in `CouncilMember` only checks for the interface IDs of `AccessControlEnumerableUpgradeable` and `ERC721EnumerableUpgradeable` and does not call the methods in the parents.

## Impact

The interfaces checked for are not interface IDs commonly used with ERC-165 and the function will return false for more commonly used implemented interfaces, which would identified with the `supportsInterface` methods in `AccessControlEnumerableUpgradeable` and `ERC721EnumerableUpgradeable`.

```solidity
function supportsInterface(
        bytes4 interfaceId
    )
        public
        pure
        override(
            AccessControlEnumerableUpgradeable,
            ERC721EnumerableUpgradeable
        )
        returns (bool)
    {
        return
            interfaceId ==
            type(AccessControlEnumerableUpgradeable).interfaceId ||
            interfaceId == type(ERC721EnumerableUpgradeable).interfaceId;
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Instead of checking for the two interfaceIds of the parent contracts, compare the return values of their `supportsInterface` methods. This will check for any well known ERC-165 implementations used in the base classes. The visibility has been changed from pure to view, to match the [[ERC-165 specification](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165)](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165).

```solidity
function supportsInterface( bytes4 interfaceId )
        public
        view 
        override( AccessControlEnumerableUpgradeable,
            ERC721EnumerableUpgradeable )
        returns (bool) {
        return
            AccessControlEnumerableUpgradeable.supportsInterface(interfaceId) ||
            ERC721EnumerableUpgradeable.supportsInterface(interfaceId);
    }
```

it("has IAccessControl interface", async () => {
    expect(await councilMember.supportsInterface('0x7965db0b')).to.equal(true);
});

it("has IERC721 interface", async () => {
    expect(await councilMember.supportsInterface('0x80ac58cd')).to.equal(true);
});

it("doesn't have unsupported interface", async () => {
    expect(await councilMember.supportsInterface('0xdeadbeef')).to.equal(false);
});
