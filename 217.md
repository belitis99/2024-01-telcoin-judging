# Existing council member can become member twice

## Summary
Already `existing` council member can become a member `twice` as there is no check if a address is an existing member of council or not

## Vulnerability Detail
New council member can be added through `mint` &  `removeFromOffice` but both the functions are lacking check on that if address is `already an existing` council member, If a council member became a member `twice` then that member will `receive` TELCOIN balance `twice` which is bad as other members will loss balance
```solidity
   function removeFromOffice(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 tokenId,
        address rewardRecipient
    ) external onlyRole(GOVERNANCE_COUNCIL_ROLE) {
        // Retrieve and distribute any pending TELCOIN for all council members
        _retrieve();
        // Withdraw all the TELCOIN rewards for the specified token to the rewardRecipient
        _withdrawAll(rewardRecipient, tokenId);
        // Transfer the token (representing the council membership) from one address to another
        _transfer(from, to, tokenId);
    }
```
```solidity
  function mint(
        address newMember
    ) external onlyRole(GOVERNANCE_COUNCIL_ROLE) {
        if (totalSupply() != 0) {
            _retrieve();
        }

        balances.push(0);
        _mint(newMember, totalSupply());
    }
```
## Impact
User can became council member twice & if that happens, that member will receive TELCOIN twice

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use a mapping or array to store council member address and add a checks in mint & removeFromOffice function or can also check if a address is holding any member NFT then should not became member again
