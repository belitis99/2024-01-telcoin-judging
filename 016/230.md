# SUPPORT_ROLE can steal tokens which they are not trusted for incase of staking contracts with double entry point tokens .

## Summary
SUPPORT_ROLE can steal tokens which they are not trusted for.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the ```StakingRewardsManager``` contract the SUPPORT_ROLE is trusted to be able to call [```recoverERC20FromStaking```](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/telx/core/StakingRewardsManager.sol#L216C5-L224C6) for any tokens accidentally sent in the staking contract.
However if there is a staking contract with double entry point tokens the  SUPPORT_ROLE can steal all the staking tokens. 

## Impact
Stakers will lose all tokens they staked.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function recoverERC20FromStaking(
        StakingRewards staking,
        IERC20 tokenAddress,
        uint256 tokenAmount,
        address to
    ) external onlyRole(SUPPORT_ROLE) {
        // grab the tokens from the staking contract
        staking.recoverERC20(to, tokenAddress, tokenAmount);
    }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
