# Reentrancy attack in `claim` function

krkba
## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
The `claim` function allows council members to withdraw their allocated amounts of `TELCOIN`. If the `TELCOIN` token contract is malicious or compromised, it could potentially trigger a reentrancy attack when `TELCOIN.safeTransfer` is called.
## Impact
It can call the `claim` function repeatedly before the original claim function execution is complete, which allow the attacker to drain funds from the contract.
