# Lack of revoke or clear token approval when removed from office

## Summary

Lack of revoke token approval when removed from office

## Vulnerability Detail

In `CouncilMember` there is `removeFromOffice` function to replace an existing council member with a new one.

The function basically withdraw all rewards to `rewardRecipient` and then transfer the tokenId to the new council member (or existing council member).

In the function, there is missing one element of removal, that is clearing the approval of that tokenId (`_tokenApproval`). There is a possible condition where the tokenId previously was approve to some other address via `approve` function. This `_tokenApproval` is not cleared in this `removeFromOffice` operation.

If we check again, the `_isAuthorized` is being used in `_isAuthorized` override function in ERC721, and can be check whether approved address is allowed to manage `owner`'s tokens, or `tokenId` in particular (ignoring whether it is owned by `owner`). Thus, this should be cleared too when removing the tokenId from original owner.

The approved address (or person) can front-run or act when there is `removeFromOffice`, and to perform any action which they should not have the capability anymore after removed from office.

```js
File: CouncilMember.sol
122:     function removeFromOffice(
123:         address from,
124:         address to,
125:         uint256 tokenId,
126:         address rewardRecipient
127:     ) external onlyRole(GOVERNANCE_COUNCIL_ROLE) {
128:         // Retrieve and distribute any pending TELCOIN for all council members
129:         _retrieve();
130:         // Withdraw all the TELCOIN rewards for the specified token to the rewardRecipient
131:         _withdrawAll(rewardRecipient, tokenId);
132:         // Transfer the token (representing the council membership) from one address to another
133:         _transfer(from, to, tokenId);
134:     }
```

## Impact

Approved user of tokenId can still execute operation as authorized user of tokenId since the `_tokenApproval` is not cleared

## Recommendation

Consider to clear up the token approval for that corresponding tokenId off `removeFromOffice` operation
