# Granted token approval remain after a token transfer.

## Summary
Token approvals not removed after a transfer which is not according to specificatoin / OZ's reference imlementation.

## Vulnerability Detail
The approve function in OZ's ERC721 has been [overridden](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/sablier/core/CouncilMember.sol#L191) in the CouncilMember contract, and a new storage variable _tokenApproval has been introduced. However, a crucial aspect that was overlooked is the removal of token approvals when a token transfer occurs.

## Impact
Unauthorized transfer of token and stealing of token's reward balance.

## Code Snippet
The following test case to be inserted in the [testing](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/test/sablier/CouncilMember.test.ts) will fail due to this reported issue:
```typescript
        describe("approve - remain", () => {
            beforeEach(async () => {
                await expect(councilMember.mint(member.address));
                expect(await councilMember.balanceOf(support.address)).to.equal(0);
            });

            describe("approval remains after successful transfer", () => {
                it("approval is created for and only for designated address", async () => {
                    await expect(councilMember.connect(admin).approve(support.address, 0)).to.be.not.reverted;
                    await expect(councilMember.connect(support).transferFrom(member.address, support.address, 0)).to.be.not.reverted;
                    expect(await councilMember.balanceOf(support.address)).to.equal(1);
                    expect(await councilMember.balanceOf(member.address)).to.equal(0);

                    // Audit note: support does not loose their approval permissions:
                    await expect(councilMember.connect(support).transferFrom(support.address, member.address, 0)).to.be.reverted;
                });
            });

        });
```

## Tool used
Manual Review.

## Recommendation
Revise the CouncilMember contract to ensure approvals are removed after a token transfers happened.

If this is an expected behaviour, this should clearly be documented (e.g. warning) in the code in order to inform about this deviation from the standard.
