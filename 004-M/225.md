# `removeFromOffice()` does not reset `_tokenApproval`

## Summary
The approved address for a given council member NFT is not resetted when an NFT is transferred.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function `removeFromOffice()` in `CouncilMember.sol` transfers an NFT to a different address but does not reset the approval given via the `_tokenApproval` variable.

## Impact
When a council member NFT is transferred the token will be approved to the same address as before the transfer.

## Recommendation
Reset the approval after the transfer:
```solidity
function removeFromOffice(address from,address to,uint256 tokenId,address rewardRecipient) external onlyRole(GOVERNANCE_COUNCIL_ROLE) {
    _retrieve();
    _withdrawAll(rewardRecipient, tokenId);
    _transfer(from, to, tokenId);
    _tokenApproval[tokenId] = address(0); âœ… 
}
```
