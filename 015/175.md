# Typo in StakingRewardsMangaer.sol/recoverERC20FromStaking

## Summary
The typo is that the parameters of the function called from `recoverERC20FromStaking` which is `recoverERC20` are not passed in a correct line which may lead to misfunctionality.
## Vulnerability Detail
`recoverERC20FromStaking` calls `recoverERC20()` with parameters sentenced like (to, tokenAddress, tokenAmount) but `recoverERC20`
accepts them sentenced like (tokenAddress, tokenAmount, to)
   ```
 function recoverERC20FromStaking(
        StakingRewards staking,
        IERC20 tokenAddress,
        uint256 tokenAmount,
        address to
    ) external onlyRole(SUPPORT_ROLE) {
        // grab the tokens from the staking contract
        staking.recoverERC20(to, tokenAddress, tokenAmount);
    }
```

```
    function recoverERC20(
        IERC20 tokenAddress,
        uint256 tokenAmount,
        address to
    ) external onlyRole(SUPPORT_ROLE) {
        //move funds
        tokenAddress.safeTransfer(to, tokenAmount);
    }
```
