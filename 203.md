# Authorization added to approve function can be bypassed

## Summary

The [`approve`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/sablier/core/CouncilMember.sol#L191-L201) function has been limited to `GOVERNANCE_COUNCIL_ROLE`  but the owner of the token can bypass this functionality and use `setApprovalForAll` function to allow spending tokens by a third-party contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `approve` function has been limited to `GOVERNANCE_COUNCIL_ROLE` and allows setting approval for any token to any address. The owner of the token can use `setApprovalForAll` function and set third-party contract as an operator which will allow to bypass authorization added to `approve` function.

## Impact

The users can use `setApprovalForAll` and allow any contract to spend the ERC721 tokens bypassing authorization added to `approve` function.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to:
- In case the approvals should be used by the users it is required to override `setApprovalForAll function`.
- In case the it should be possible by user to manage his own approval it is recommended to implement additional function such as `approveToken` instead of overriding existing `approve` function.
