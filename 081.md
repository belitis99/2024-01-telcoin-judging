# Miscommunication between two different roles Will lead to loss of staking tokens

## Summary
The `BUILDER_ROLE` the only role allowed to call the `removeStakingRewardsContract` function, when this function gets call the staking contract cease to exist which is intended, However the logic isn't confirming if tokens sent/staked  to the contract have been  recovered.
This is an issue because the `recoverERC20FromStaking` function is called be a different role 
Miscommunication Between the two roles will lead to loss of tokens 
## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit%2Fcontracts%2Ftelx%2Fcore%2FStakingRewardsManager.sol#L166-L179
```solidity
    function removeStakingRewardsContract(
        uint256 i
    ) external onlyRole(BUILDER_ROLE) {
        StakingRewards staking = stakingContracts[i];

        // un-mark this staking contract as included in stakingContracts
        stakingExists[staking] = false;
        // replace the removed staking contract with the last item in the stakingContracts array
        stakingContracts[i] = stakingContracts[stakingContracts.length - 1];
        // pop the last staking contract off the array
        stakingContracts.pop();

        emit StakingRemoved(staking);
    }
```

```solidity
 function recoverERC20FromStaking(
        StakingRewards staking,
        IERC20 tokenAddress,
        uint256 tokenAmount,
        address to
    ) external onlyRole(SUPPORT_ROLE) {
        // grab the tokens from the staking contract
        staking.recoverERC20(to, tokenAddress, tokenAmount);
    }
```
The function can only be called buy the `SUPPOR_ROLE`, if this function have not been called by the Support before the Builder calls the `removeStakingRewardsContract` the tokens in the staking contract will all be lost. 
## Impact
Tokens will be lost if there is a breach in communication 
## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a check in the `removeStakingRewardsContract` confirmimg if the tokens have been recovered before removing it completely
