# Lack of Validation:

## Summary
Lack of Validation: When setting the rewardsDistribution address, there is no check to ensure that the address is a contract and not a regular externally owned account (EOA). This could lead to errors if an EOA is mistakenly set as the rewardsDistribution.

## Vulnerability Detail
 function setRewardsDistribution(
        address rewardsDistribution_
    ) external onlyOwner {
        rewardsDistribution = rewardsDistribution_;
        emit RewardsDistributionUpdated(rewardsDistribution);
    }

## Impact
there is no check to ensure that the address is a contract and not a regular externally owned account (EOA). This could lead to errors if an EOA is mistakenly set as the rewardsDistribution.
