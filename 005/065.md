# No Time Locks or Multi-Sig:

## Summary
No Time Locks or Multi-Sig: For high-value contracts, it is often recommended to have time locks or multi-signature requirements for critical operations like changing the rewards distribution address. This contract does not implement such mechanisms.

## Vulnerability Detail
function setRewardsDistribution(
        address rewardsDistribution_
    ) external onlyOwner {
        rewardsDistribution = rewardsDistribution_;
        emit RewardsDistributionUpdated(rewardsDistribution);
    }
## Impact
