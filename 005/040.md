# Missing Address Validation in setRewardsDistribution Function

## Summary
The vulnerability is related to the absence of a check for the zero address in the setRewardsDistribution function, allowing the assignment of an invalid address.


## Vulnerability Detail
The setRewardsDistribution function in the RewardsDistributionRecipient.sol contract lacks validation to check whether the provided rewardsDistribution_ address is not the zero address (address(0)). This omission could potentially lead to issues, as the contract might lose control over the reward distribution if rewardsDistribution_ is the zero address.
## Impact
If an attacker provides the zero address as the rewardsDistribution_ argument, it could lead to unexpected behavior, and the contract might lose control over the reward distribution mechanism.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to add a validation check at the beginning of the setRewardsDistribution function to ensure that the provided rewardsDistribution_ address is not the zero address. This can be achieved using the following modification:
```solidity
require(rewardsDistribution_ != address(0), "Invalid rewards distribution address");
```
