# Inadequate Validation in proposeTransaction Function

## Summary
The proposeTransaction function lacks sufficient validation for the input arrays, potentially leading to inconsistencies or unintended behavior.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function allows a proposer to specify an array of destinations and corresponding amounts for Telcoin distribution. However, there are no checks to ensure that the lengths of these arrays are equal or that the sum of the amounts matches the total withdrawal amount. This oversight could lead to situations where the total distributed amount does not align with the intended withdrawal amount.

## Impact
This vulnerability can lead to discrepancies in fund distribution, resulting in either excess distribution or funds remaining in the contract, potentially causing financial discrepancies or loss.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
// TelcoinDistributor.sol - Line 93
function proposeTransaction(uint256 totalWithdrawl, address[] memory destinations, uint256[] memory amounts) external onlyCouncilMember whenNotPaused {
    // ... existing code ...
    // Validation needed for destinations and amounts arrays
    proposedTransactions.push(ProposedTransaction({
        totalWithdrawl: totalWithdrawl,
        destinations: destinations,
        amounts: amounts,
        // ...
    }));
    // ... existing code ...
}
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement checks to ensure that the lengths of destinations and amounts arrays are equal and that their combined total matches the totalWithdrawl amount. This will ensure consistency and prevent potential fund misallocation.
