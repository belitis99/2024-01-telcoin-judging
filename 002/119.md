# Improper input validation in `telcoinDistributor::proposeTransaction`

## Summary
A transaction can be created with different length of `destinations` and `amount`, if that happens it will revert while executing with `out-of-bound` error

## Vulnerability Detail
`telcoinDistributor::proposeTransaction` is taking destinations and amounts array as inputs, there can be a scenario where there lengths are not same as there is no checks, if that happens then transaction will revert even after it has no challenge because of `out-of-bound` error
```solidity
    function proposeTransaction(
        uint256 totalWithdrawl,
        address[] memory destinations,
        uint256[] memory amounts
    ) external onlyCouncilMember whenNotPaused {
        // Pushing the proposed transaction to the array
        proposedTransactions.push(
            ProposedTransaction({
                totalWithdrawl: totalWithdrawl,
                destinations: destinations,
                amounts: amounts,
                timestamp: uint64(block.timestamp),
                challenged: false,
                executed: false
            })
        );

        // Emitting an event after proposing a transaction
        emit TransactionProposed(proposedTransactions.length - 1, _msgSender());
    }
```

## Impact
Transaction will revert even after having no challenge

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use checks in proposeTransaction()
```diff
+  require(destinations.length == amounts.length && destinations.length > 0 && amounts.length > 0, "TelcoinDistributor: Invalid length");
```
