# `batchTelcoin` will revert if the `totalWithdrawl` is not equal to the `amount ` being sent

## Summary
Council members can create `proposalTransaction` to send `Telcoin` to specific addresses with specified `amount`, the total of the `amount` Is the `totalWithdrawl` to be taken from the safe
```solidity
function proposeTransaction(
        uint256 totalWithdrawl,
        address[] memory destinations,
        uint256[] memory amounts
    ) external onlyCouncilMember whenNotPaused {
        // Pushing the proposed transaction to the array
        proposedTransactions.push(
            ProposedTransaction({
                totalWithdrawl: totalWithdrawl,
                destinations: destinations,
                amounts: amounts,
                timestamp: uint64(block.timestamp),
                challenged: false,
                executed: false
            })
        );

        // Emitting an event after proposing a transaction
        emit TransactionProposed(proposedTransactions.length - 1, _msgSender());
    }
```
If no one challanges the transaction `batchTelcoin` gets called and the transfers are made to the addresses .. However there's no check if the `totalWithdrawl` is equal to the `amount` being sent 

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
    function batchTelcoin(
        uint256 totalWithdrawl,
        address[] memory destinations,
        uint256[] memory amounts
    ) internal {
        // stores inital balance
        uint256 initialBalance = TELCOIN.balanceOf(address(this));
        //transfers amounts
        TELCOIN.safeTransferFrom(owner(), address(this), totalWithdrawl);
        for (uint i = 0; i < destinations.length; i++) {
            TELCOIN.safeTransfer(destinations[i], amounts[i]);
        }
        //initial balance is used instead of zero
        //if 0 is used instead stray Telcoin could DNS operations
        require(
            TELCOIN.balanceOf(address(this)) == initialBalance,
            "TelcoinDistributor: must not have leftovers"
        );
    }
```
The function first takes the `initialBalance` of the contract then transfers `Telcoin` from the safe into the contract before sending it to the `destinations`  after which it checks if the balance of the contract is equal to the `initialBalance` this is meant to revert if there's any leftover from the transaction.

The lack of check if `totalWithdrawl` is equal to the `amount` will make successful proposal fail of there is leftovers.

If the ` totalWithdrawal`  is less than the sum of the transferred amounts, the  `require`  statement will trigger a revert, as the leftover tokens would not align with the initial balance.

Conversely, if the  `totalWithdrawal`  is greater than the sum of the transferred amounts, the ` require`  statement will also result in a revert, as the leftover tokens would not match the initial balance.

In both scenarios, the contract would revert due to the inconsistency between the ` totalWithdrawal ` and the actual sum of the transferred token amounts.
## Impact
The revert should only happen if there is left over tokens from failed transfers only not if the `totalWithdrawl` is less than or greater than the total `amount`

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Include a check to confirm if the `amount` total is equal to the `totalWithdrawl`
