# Unstable Transaction Handling in `TelcoinDistributor::proposeTransaction` due to mismatch in array lengths

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `TelcoinDistributor::proposeTransaction` function, users (specifically council members) can propose transactions by providing two arrays: `destinations` (recipient addresses) and `amounts` (Telcoin amounts). The absence of a check to ensure these arrays are of equal length allows for the possibility of submitting a proposal with an unequal number of destinations and amounts. This design flaw is a significant oversight in the contract's logic.

## Impact
It can lead to unpredictable transaction behavior, potential financial loss, and a compromise in the contract’s integrity.

## Proof of Concept

Consider a scenario with Alice and Attacker:
-   **Alice (Honest Council Member)**: Intends to propose a legitimate transaction.
-   **Attacker (Malicious Council Member)**: Seeks to exploit the array length mismatch vulnerability.

### Step-by-Step Exploitation

1.  **Legitimate Proposal by Alice**:
    
    -   Alice prepares a transaction proposal to distribute 400 Telcoin equally among four recipients.
    -   She correctly sets `destinations`: `[Address1, Address2, Address3, Address4]`.
    -   She correctly sets `amounts`: `[100, 100, 100, 100]`.
    -   Alice submits the proposal using `proposeTransaction`.
2.  **Malicious Proposal by Attacker**:
    
    -   The attacker, another council member, prepares a transaction proposal.
    -   The attacker deliberately sets mismatched arrays:
        -   `destinations`: `[VictimAddress1, VictimAddress2]`.
        -   `amounts`: `[150, 150, 200]` (Intentionally providing an extra amount).
    -   The attacker submits this proposal using `proposeTransaction`.
3.  **Contract's Flawed Acceptance**:
    
    -   The contract, lacking a validation check, accepts both proposals.
    -   The attacker's proposal now has an unallocated amount of 200 Telcoin.
4.  **Execution of Proposals**:
    
    -   When proposals are executed:
        -   Alice’s proposal is processed normally.
        -   In the attacker's proposal, the first two amounts (150 Telcoin each) are sent to the two specified victims.
        -   The extra 200 Telcoin remains unallocated, creating a discrepancy in the contract's ledger.
5.  **Consequences**:
    
    -   The unallocated 200 Telcoin results in an inconsistent state within the contract.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement an array length equality check in the `proposeTransaction` function:
```solidity
function proposeTransaction(
    uint256 totalWithdrawl,
    address[] memory destinations,
    uint256[] memory amounts
) external onlyCouncilMember whenNotPaused {
    require(destinations.length == amounts.length, "Array length mismatch: destinations and amounts must be equal.");

    // Rest of the existing function code
    // ...
}
```
