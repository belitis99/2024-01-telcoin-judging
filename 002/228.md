# Missing check for equal length arrays in TelcoinDistributor: proposeTransaction()

## Summary
The `proposeTransaction()` functions in `TelcoinDistributor.sol` does not check whether the lengths of the arrays submitted are equal. This can lead to unexpected results.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `proposeTransaction()` function, the council member submits two arrays (`destinations`, and `amounts`)

The expectation is that the council member submitting the function will ensure that the indexes of the arrays correspond to the correct values in the other arrays, thus that the lengths will be the same. Common practice in such a situation is to verify that the lengths are equal to ensure the council member hasn't made an error.

However, in this functions, we simply iterate through the destinations array without performing this check, and then call out `safeTransfer()` for each destination separately in `batchTelcoin()`

```solidity
        for (uint i = 0; i < destinations.length; i++) {
            TELCOIN.safeTransfer(destinations[i], amounts[i]);
        }
```

## Impact
If the `destinations` array is shorter than the `amounts` arrays, the additional values in the `amounts` arrays will be ignored. This could lead to transfers with unexpected results, while `destinations` array is longer than the `amounts` arrays, it would make the batchTelcoin() always revert since amounts[i] doesn't exist.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a check to the proposeTransaction() function that confirms that destinations, and amounts are all equal in length.
```solidity
+ require(destinations.length == amounts .length, "mismatched array lengths");
```
