# The variables of proposeTransactions are not checked properly

## Summary

Telcoin Distributor contract `proposeTransaction()` does not check the totalWithdrawal, destinations and amount properly, which will affect the actual proposal when it comes to execution.

## Vulnerability Detail

`proposeTransaction()` simply pushes the array into the propsedTransactions array without checking the variables.

```solidity
  function proposeTransaction(
        uint256 totalWithdrawl,
        address[] memory destinations,
        uint256[] memory amounts
    ) external onlyCouncilMember whenNotPaused {
        // Pushing the proposed transaction to the array
        proposedTransactions.push(
            ProposedTransaction({
                totalWithdrawl: totalWithdrawl,
                destinations: destinations,
                amounts: amounts,
                timestamp: uint64(block.timestamp),
                challenged: false,
                executed: false
            })
        );
```

When it comes to execution, the sum of the amount must be equal to the total withdrawal. Also, the length of the destinations array should be equal to the length of the amounts array as well.

Since these variables are not checked thoroughly, after it passes the challenge period, the execution will be reverted.

## Impact

The execution will be reverted after challenge period, which wastes time.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Recommend checking that totalWithdrawal == all the amounts and that the length of the destinations == amounts in the proposeTransaction funciton.
