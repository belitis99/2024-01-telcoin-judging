# Missing check if the sum of amounts value in array equals to totalWithdrawl in proposeTransaction()

## Summary
The `proposeTransaction()` functions in `TelcoinDistributor.sol` does not check whether the sum of `amounts` and `totalWithdrawl` are equal. This can lead to unexpected results.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `proposeTransaction()` function, the council member submits the array of `amounts` value which will be later sent and a value of `totalWithdrawl` as a representative of the amounts value summary.

However, in this functions, there is no check if the total value of these `amounts` equal `totalWithdrawl`

## Impact
If the sum of `amounts` is smaller or larger than `totalWithdrawl`, the proposed transaction will always be reverted caused by the logic of `batchTelcoin()`:
```solidity
        require(
            TELCOIN.balanceOf(address(this)) == initialBalance,
            "TelcoinDistributor: must not have leftovers"
        );
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a check to the proposed transaction () function that confirms that total value of amounts, and totalWithdrawl are all equal.

```solidity
+ uint256 totalAmount;
+ for (uint256 i = 0; i <= amounts.length; i++) {
+             totalAmount += amounts[i]
+ {
+ require(totalWithdrawl == totalAmount, "mismatched array lengths");
```
