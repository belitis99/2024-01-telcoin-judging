# Proposals in TelcoinDistributor don't get paused when the contract is paused

## Summary

If the contract gets paused, proposed transactions ongoing the challenge period won't get paused and could get approved when they shouldn't.

## Vulnerability Detail

[challengeTransaction()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/protocol/core/TelcoinDistributor.sol#L115-L117) is not callable when the contract is paused. This means that transaction proposals in the challenge period would be going through this period without the risk of being rejected while the contract is paused.

## Impact

Council members could be unable to challenge malicious transactions if TelcoinDistributor is paused.
