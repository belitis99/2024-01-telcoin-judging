# Transaction can not be challenged during the pause, which can lead to transaction to be maliciously executed

## Summary
When contract is paused, function `challengeTransaction()` is also paused, and there is no extended time after pausing, which could make malicious transaction executed

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `TelcoinDistributor` contract, function `challengeTransaction` is used by council member to challenge the transaction in the challenge period:

    function challengeTransaction(
        uint256 transactionId
    ) external onlyCouncilMember whenNotPaused {
        // Makes sure the id exists
        require(
            transactionId < proposedTransactions.length,
            "TelcoinDistributor: Invalid index"
        );

        // Reverts if the current time exceeds the sum of the transaction's timestamp and the challenge period
        require(
            block.timestamp <=
                proposedTransactions[transactionId].timestamp + challengePeriod,
            "TelcoinDistributor: Challenge period has ended"
        );

        // Sets the challenged flag of the proposed transaction to true
        proposedTransactions[transactionId].challenged = true;

        // Emits an event with the transaction ID and the challenger's address
        emit TransactionChallenged(transactionId, _msgSender());
    }

It use `whenNotPaused`, which mean function can not be executed when contract is paused (when contract is hacked, ...), but there is no extend for the time when contract is paused, which can be seen at `executeTransaction()` function:

        require(
            block.timestamp >
                proposedTransactions[transactionId].timestamp + challengePeriod,
            "TelcoinDistributor: Challenge period has not ended"
        );
It only check if `challengePeriod` is passed or not, it do not calculate the time when contract is paused

## Impact
Malicious transaction can be executed when contract is paused long enough
