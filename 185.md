# Unbounded nonces array

## Summary

Nonces array can grow too large to fit the iteration in one block.

## Vulnerability Detail

`SafeGuard` lets the owner to veto tx nonce:
```solidity
    uint256[] public nonces;

    function vetoTransaction(
        bytes32 transactionHash,
        uint256 nonce
    ) public onlyOwner {
         ...
        nonces.push(nonce);
    }
```

`nonces` is a dynamic array, and it only grows with new values over time. Later, when validating the tx, it iterates over all the nonces:
```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < nonces.length; i++)
```
This loop can eventually grow so large as to make future operations of the contract cost too much gas to fit in a block.

## Impact

Iterating through the arrays of unknown sizes might consume all the gas provided (run out of gas) if too many elements are pushed. This might be less relevant on other chains where gas limits are lifted, but concerning if deployed on Mainnet. The sponsor confirmed that `SafeGuard` will be deployed on Mainnet: "Some of the contracts will also be deployed to Ethereum." "Currently the only contracts would be the Telcoin distributor or the safe guard. Everything else would be on polygon".

## Recommendation

Consider refactoring the codebase to avoid such iterations. Add upper limits, the possibility to remove nonces, and other appropriate improvements.
