# Unchecked Return Values:

## Summary
Unchecked Return Values: The contract does not check the return values of external calls to StakingRewards methods (e.g., staking.setRewardsDistribution(address(this))). While this is generally safe for well-known, trusted contracts, it's a good practice to handle potential reverts or false returns.

## Vulnerability Detail
 function _addStakingRewardsContract(
        StakingRewards staking,
        StakingConfig calldata config
    ) internal {
        // in order to manage this contract we have to own it
        // staking.acceptOwnership();
        // in order to top up rewards, we have to be rewardsDistribution. this is an onlyOwner function
        staking.setRewardsDistribution(address(this));

        // push staking onto stakingContracts array
        stakingContracts.push(staking);
        // set staking config
        stakingConfigs[staking] = config;
        // mark inclusion in the stakingContracts array
        stakingExists[staking] = true;

        emit StakingAdded(staking, config);
    }
## Impact
The contract does not check the return values of external calls to StakingRewards methods (e.g., staking.setRewardsDistribution(address(this))). While this is generally safe for well-known, trusted contracts, it's a good practice to handle potential reverts or false returns.
