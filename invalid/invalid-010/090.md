# Topping up can be front-runned

## Summary

The [`topUp`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/telx/core/StakingRewardsManager.sol#L254-L278) function of `StakingRewardsManager` contract facilitates [the transfer of reward tokens from the source to the staking contract](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/telx/core/StakingRewardsManager.sol#L267-L271). The issue arises because any user with the `EXECUTOR_ROLE` can front-run the topping-up process and use the approved `source` tokens to fund staking contracts of their choice.

## Vulnerability Detail

The top-up functionality requires approving the `StakingRewardsManager` contract to spend the `rewardToken`, and then `topUp` can be called permissionlessly. The function utilizes [`transferFrom` of `rewardToken`, with the `source`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/telx/core/StakingRewardsManager.sol#L267-L271) passed as an argument. This introduces an exploitation scenario where an attacker with `EXECUTOR_ROLE` can monitor approvals for the `StakingRewardsManager` contract and front-run the transaction by passing the target's source but using an array of indices of their choice. This will allow attacker to fund staking contracts of his choice.

## Impact

An attacker with the `EXECUTOR_ROLE` can exploit the system to steal reward tokens and use them to top up the staking contracts of their choice.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to always use `msg.sender` as the first argument for `transferFrom` function, so only the caller can top-up the staking contracts.
