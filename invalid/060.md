# Centralization Risk:

## Summary
Centralization Risk: Since the contract relies on the Ownable pattern, there is a central point of control (the owner). If the owner's private key is compromised, the attacker could change the rewardsDistribution address to a malicious one.

## Vulnerability Detail
 function setRewardsDistribution(
        address rewardsDistribution_
    ) external onlyOwner {
        rewardsDistribution = rewardsDistribution_;
        emit RewardsDistributionUpdated(rewardsDistribution);
    }

## Impact
If the owner's private key is compromised, the attacker could change the rewardsDistribution address to a malicious one.
