# `SUPPORT_ROLE` can steal TELCOIN by calling `recoverERC20FromStaking()` function

## Summary
`SUPPORT_ROLE` can steal all token by calling `recoverERC20FromStaking` function due to no restriction to call it

## Vulnerability Detail
Function `recoverERC20FromStaking()` is used to recover erc20 token from contract:

    function recoverERC20FromStaking(
        StakingRewards staking,
        IERC20 tokenAddress,
        uint256 tokenAmount,
        address to
    ) external onlyRole(SUPPORT_ROLE) {
        // grab the tokens from the staking contract
        staking.recoverERC20(to, tokenAddress, tokenAmount);
    }
