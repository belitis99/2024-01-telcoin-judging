# Unused Implementation Address:

## Summary
Unused Implementation Address: The stakingRewardsImplementation is set but never used. This could be a leftover from a previous design where the factory might have been intended to use a proxy pattern for creating new StakingRewards contracts. If it's not needed, it should be removed to avoid confusion.

## Vulnerability Detail
   constructor(address implementation) Ownable(_msgSender()) {
        stakingRewardsImplementation = implementation;
    }
## Impact
This could be a leftover from a previous design where the factory might have been intended to use a proxy pattern for creating new StakingRewards contracts. If it's not needed, it should be removed to avoid confusion.
