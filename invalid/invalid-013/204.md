# Anyone can call recoverERC20, pause, unpause, and setChallengePeriod functions because of wrong "onlyOwner" implementation

## Summary
Anyone can call recoverERC20, pause, unpause, and setChallengePeriod functions because of wrong "onlyOwner" implementation

## Vulnerability Detail
Checking the package.json of the contract, it shows that the contract uses Openzeppelin's contract version 5 upward:

"dependencies": { "@openzeppelin/contracts": "^5.0.1", "@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable": "^5.0.1" }

The TelecoinDistributor.sol calls `Ownable(_msgSender())` in its constructor. However, the vulnerability lies in using `_msgSender()` which is a function inherited by `Ownable.sol` from `Context.sol`. `_msgSender()` is a function that only returns the immediate sender of a call. 

What this means for the `onlyOwner` modifier used in recoverERC20, pause, unpause, and setChallengePeriod functions is that it will not revert when called by anyone. This is as a result of calling `msgSender()` in the constructor. `_msgSender()` doesn't set any address as the owner. It only returns the immediate sender of a call.

And because of calling _msgSender() in the TelcoinDistributor.sol's constructor, functions marked with `onlyOwner` will only return the address calling the function and not revert.

Here's the function in the Context.sol inherited by Ownable.sol:

`function _msgSender() internal view virtual returns (address) { return msg.sender; }`


 ## Impact
Anyone can call recoverERC20, pause, unpause, and setChallengePeriod functions

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

msg.sender should be used instead of _msgSender()
