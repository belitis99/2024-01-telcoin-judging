# Potential Reentrancy Vulnerability in batchTelcoin Function

## Summary
The batchTelcoin function in the TelcoinDistributor.sol contract is potentially vulnerable to reentrancy attacks, which can lead to unexpected contract behavior or exploits.

## Vulnerability Detail
The batchTelcoin function iterates over an array to distribute Telcoin tokens to multiple destinations using ERC20 safeTransfer. This function does not have a reentrancy guard, and if any destination is a contract, it might allow for unexpected reentrant calls.

## Impact
Reentrancy attacks can result in loss of funds, manipulation of contract states, and compromise the integrity of the contract.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
// TelcoinDistributor.sol
function batchTelcoin(uint256 totalWithdrawl, address[] memory destinations, uint256[] memory amounts) internal {
    // ... existing code ...
    for (uint i = 0; i < destinations.length; i++) {
        // Potential reentrancy risk on the line below
        TELCOIN.safeTransfer(destinations[i], amounts[i]);
    }
    // ... existing code ...
}
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a reentrancy guard in the batchTelcoin function using the nonReentrant modifier from OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard contract to prevent reentrant calls.
