# Council members have the ability to transfer their NFTs to others.

## Summary
The creation of new council members should be community-driven, but the current implementation does not correctly reflect this.
## Vulnerability Detail
There is a disparity in permission control for `NFT` transfers. 
While the `removeFromOffice` function requires the governance `role` to be called, the `transferFrom` and` safeTransferFrom` functions work without any permission checks. 
This allows council members to easily send their `NFT`s using these functions.
```solidity
function removeFromOffice(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId, address rewardRecipient) 
external onlyRole(GOVERNANCE_COUNCIL_ROLE) {
    _retrieve();
    _withdrawAll(rewardRecipient, tokenId);
    _transfer(from, to, tokenId);
}
```
