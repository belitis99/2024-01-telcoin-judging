# Use safeTransferFrom instead of transferFrom

## Summary
The transferFrom() function returns a boolean value indicating success. This parameter needs to be checked to see if the transfer has been successful.

## Vulnerability Detail
Some tokens like [EURS](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdb25f211ab05b1c97d595516f45794528a807ad8#code) and [BAT](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0d8775f648430679a709e98d2b0cb6250d2887ef#code) will not revert if the transfer failed but return false instead.
So if the `rewardToken` is one of these tokens, the return value is not checked:
```solidity
function topUp(
        address source,
        uint256[] memory indices
    ) external onlyRole(EXECUTOR_ROLE) {
        for (uint i = 0; i < indices.length; i++) {
            // get staking contract and config
            StakingRewards staking = stakingContracts[i];
            StakingConfig memory config = stakingConfigs[staking];

            // will revert if block.timestamp <= periodFinish
            staking.setRewardsDuration(config.rewardsDuration);

            // pull tokens from owner of this contract to fund the staking contract
            rewardToken.transferFrom(
                source,
                address(staking),
                config.rewardAmount
            );

            // start periods
            staking.notifyRewardAmount(config. rewardAmount);

            emit ToppedUp(staking, config);
        }
    }
```

Do to that the `notifyRewardAmount` is called just after `transferFrom` and `StakingRewards` is out-of-scope, so any accounting/protcol-update which has not considered `false`-transfers inside the `notifyRewardAmount`, will cause major problems for the protocol.

## Impact
Any update/accounting inside the `notifyRewardAmount` without considering `false`-transfers, will cause major problems for the protocol.
