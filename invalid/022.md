# Risk of locked assets due to use of _mint instead of _safeMint

## Summary
ERC-721 tokens are minted via the _mint function rather than the _safeMint function.
Due to that a councilMember can be contract, the `_safeMint` should be used.

## Vulnerability Detail
The _safeMint function includes a necessary safety check that validates a recipient contractâ€™s ability to receive and handle ERC-721 tokens.
Without this safeguard, tokens can inadvertently be sent to an incompatible contract, causing them, and any assets they hold, to become irretrievable:
```solidity
function mint(
        address newMember
    ) external onlyRole(GOVERNANCE_COUNCIL_ROLE) {
        if (totalSupply() != 0) {
            _retrieve();
        }

        balances.push(0);
        _mint(newMember, totalSupply());
    }
```
## Impact
If councilMember contract is unable to receive ERC721 tokens (doesn't support onERC721Received), the NFT asset will be lost.
