# lock funds indefinitely or make challenging impractical due to challengePeriod .

## Summary
The challengePeriod is set during construction and can be updated by the owner, but there is no check to prevent setting it to an unreasonably high or low value, which could either lock funds indefinitely or make challenging impractical.

## Vulnerability Detail
 function setChallengePeriod(uint256 newPeriod) public onlyOwner {
        //update period
        challengePeriod = newPeriod;
        // Emitting an event for new period
        emit ChallengePeriodUpdated(challengePeriod);
    }
## Impact
there is no check to prevent setting it to an unreasonably high or low value, which could either lock funds indefinitely or make challenging impractical.
