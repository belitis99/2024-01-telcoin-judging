# Missing event for TelcoinDistributor.sol's executeTransaction

## Summary
TelcoinDistributor.sol executeTransaction doesnt emit events to record the executed Transactions on-chain for off-chain monitors/tools/interfaces to register the updates and react if necessary.  

## Vulnerability Detail
TelcoinDistributor.sol doesnt emit an event when executing transactions in executeTransaction method  making difficult to offchain products to keep track of executed transactions

## Impact
The impact of this is that there is no way to off-chain monitors/tools/interfaces to register and keep track of the payments (token distribution).  
Missing events do not promote transparency and affect  perception of fairness or trustworthiness, they could stop using the protocol  

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Recommend to consider emitting events when these addresses/values are updated. This will be more transparent and it will make it easier to keep track of the status of the system.
