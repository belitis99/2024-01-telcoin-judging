# Council members can transfer their NFTs to someone else

## Summary

Council Members can transfer their NFTs although they are not supposed to.

## Vulnerability Detail

Protocol mentions:

>  There will be governance votes in which the councel members are elected. This is why **they cannot transfer their own NFTs**. only the election process can switch them.

Council members can transfer their own NFTs by calling the transferFrom function in ERC721 since the function is not overriden in CouncilMember.sol. 

```solidity
ERC721.sol
     * @dev See {IERC721-transferFrom}.
     */
    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId) public virtual override {
        //solhint-disable-next-line max-line-length
        require(_isApprovedOrOwner(_msgSender(), tokenId), "ERC721: caller is not token owner or approved");


        _transfer(from, to, tokenId);
    }


    /**
     * @dev See {IERC721-safeTransferFrom}.
     */
    function safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId) public virtual override {
        safeTransferFrom(from, to, tokenId, "");
    }


    /**
     * @dev See {IERC721-safeTransferFrom}.
     */
    function safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId, bytes memory data) public virtual override {
        require(_isApprovedOrOwner(_msgSender(), tokenId), "ERC721: caller is not token owner or approved");
        _safeTransfer(from, to, tokenId, data);
    }
```

The call to `_transfer` will call the `_beforeTokenTransfer()` hook, which will call ERC721Enumerable.sol, which will update the index.

```solidity
ERC721Enumerable.sol
_beforeTokenTransfer()
        if (from == address(0)) {
            _addTokenToAllTokensEnumeration(tokenId);
        } else if (from != to) {
            _removeTokenFromOwnerEnumeration(from, tokenId);
        }
        if (to == address(0)) {
            _removeTokenFromAllTokensEnumeration(tokenId);
        } else if (to != from) {
            _addTokenToOwnerEnumeration(to, tokenId);
```

## Impact

Council members can transfer tokens to another address, which can affect the proposal, challenge and execution part of the protocol in Telcion Distributor.sol. 

Council members that are about to get their tokenId burned can transfer their token to another address, bypassing the burn.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Recommend overriding and reverting all the transferFrom functions in ERC721 so that the council member cannot transfer tokens to another address.

Only CouncilMember.sol can directly call the `_transfer()` internal function in ERC721.sol.
