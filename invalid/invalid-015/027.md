# Denial of Service because of looping over unbounded array

## Summary

Iterating over an unbounded array can result in a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to high gas costs.

## Vulnerability Detail

As the number of members increases in the `CouncilMember` smart contract, a new element is added to the `balances` array to track the individual balances of each member. This can lead to significantly more expensive transactions when invoking the `_retrieve` function, as it loops over the entire balances array. The high gas costs associated with these transactions may render the application unusable, as users would be reluctant to pay for such expensive transactions.

## Impact

This vulnerability will make 6 functions unusable because they use `_retrieve` function internally.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Limit the number of balances that can be created, for example maximum 25 balances.

## PoC

Install and set `hardhat-gas-reporter` plugin. Add following code to test file to see difference with one balance and one hundred balances.

```javascript
describe("Denial Of Service", () => {
            it("Testing gas with one user", async () => {
                await expect(councilMember.mint(member.address));
                expect(await telcoin.balanceOf(member.address)).to.equal(0);
                expect(await councilMember.balances(0)).to.equal(0);

                await expect(councilMember.retrieve()).to.not.reverted;
                expect(await councilMember.balances(0)).to.equal(100);
                // results here is 125473
            });
            
            it("Testing gas with one hundred users", async () => {
                for(let i = 0; i < 100; i++){
                    const wallet = ethers.Wallet.createRandom().connect(ethers.provider);
                    await expect(councilMember.mint(wallet.address));
                }

                await expect(councilMember.retrieve()).to.not.reverted;
                // results here is 628150
            });// it's 5 times expensive
        });
```
