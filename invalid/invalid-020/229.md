# Potentially incorrect access control in _isAuthorized

## Summary

The `@notice` states different access requirements to the `@dev` and code implementation.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `@notice` comment states that the function determines if an address is approved or the owner, whereas the `@dev` comment and the code implementation state the address should have `GOVERNANCE_COUNCIL_ROLE` or be the approved address. Since this function is not used, it is assumed this will be used in a future upgraded contract implemation. It is unclear what is purpose is or what the desired access requirements are.

## Impact

Potentially incorrect access control.
