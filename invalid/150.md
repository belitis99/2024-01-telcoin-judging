# `removeFromOffice()` can be frontrun by council member

## Summary
The function `removeFromOffice()` can be front-run by the council member being replaced to claim `TELCOIN` tokens before they get replaced.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function `removeFromOffice()` in `CouncilMember.sol` can be called by the `GOVERNANCE_COUNCIL_ROLE` to replace a specific council member with another one. The `GOVERNANCE_COUNCIL_ROLE` can specify an address `rewardRecipient` to which the current amount of `TELCOIN` owed to the council member being replaced will be sent.

A sophisticated council member can frontrun the call to `removeFromOffice()` with a call to `claim()` claiming `TELCOIN` before they get withdrawn to `rewardRecipient`.

## Impact

Sophisticated council members have an advantage over non-sophisticated ones when it comes to the function `removeFromOffice()` because they are able to claim tokens they should not be able to claim.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Other protocols solved this issue by implementing a claim queue. Meaning council members signal their intention to claim `TELCOIN` tokens and only after a pre-deteremined amount of time (ex. 3 days) they can transfer the tokens to themselves.
