# creation or loss of tokens

## Summary
The batchTelcoin function requires the contract to have a balance equal to the initial balance after transfers, which prevents the creation or loss of tokens. However, this check could be problematic if there are any unrelated token transfers to the contract, as it would prevent the execution of any transactions.

## Vulnerability Detail
 uint256 initialBalance = TELCOIN.balanceOf(address(this));
        //transfers amounts
        TELCOIN.safeTransferFrom(owner(), address(this), totalWithdrawl);
        for (uint i = 0; i < destinations.length; i++) {
            TELCOIN.safeTransfer(destinations[i], amounts[i]);
        }
        //initial balance is used instead of zero
        //if 0 is used instead stray Telcoin could DNS operations
        require(
            TELCOIN.balanceOf(address(this)) == initialBalance,
            "TelcoinDistributor: must not have leftovers"
        );
    }
## Impact
 It would prevent the execution of any transactions.
