# CouncilMember.sol does not comply with ERC721, breaking composability

## Summary

The CouncilMember NFT does not comply with ERC721.

## Vulnerability Detail

CouncilMember.sol implements supportsInterface as shown below.

```solidity

    function supportsInterface(
        bytes4 interfaceId
    )
        public
        pure
        override(
            AccessControlEnumerableUpgradeable,
            ERC721EnumerableUpgradeable
        )
        returns (bool)
    {
        return
            interfaceId ==
            type(AccessControlEnumerableUpgradeable).interfaceId ||
            interfaceId == type(ERC721EnumerableUpgradeable).interfaceId;
    }
```

The function only supports ERC721 extension , and does not comply with ERC721 itself. From [EIP721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721): 

> "Every ERC-721 compliant contract must implement the ERC721 and ERC165 interfaces (subject to “caveats” below):"

## Impact

Any contract that will make sure it is dealing with an ERC721 compliant NFT will not interoperate with Council Member tokens.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Recommend adding `interfaceId == type(IERC721).interfaceId` to comply with ERC721 as well.
