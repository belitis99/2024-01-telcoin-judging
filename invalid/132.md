# Two different transactions can result in the same transactionHash

## Summary
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
  bytes32 transactionHash = IReality(_msgSender()).getTransactionHash(     
                to,  
                value,
                data,
                operation,
                nonces[i]
            );
```
As we can see in getTransactionHash, lack of chainId may lead to same transactionHash is generated for different chains 

## Impact
If there is no chainId to distinguish between different chains, then two completely different transactions on different chains might generate the same hash. This means that the function could mistakenly consider a legitimate transaction as having been vetoed because it shares the same hash with a transaction from another chain

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to include the ChainId in the getTransactionHash to calculate the transactionHash. By doing so different transactions coming from different chains will not result into the same transactionHash
