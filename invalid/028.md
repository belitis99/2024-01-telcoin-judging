# `removeFromOffice` doesn't check if `to` is already a council member

## Summary
When a council member becomes malicious or for some other reasons the `GOVERNANCE_COUNCIL_ROLE` will call `removeFromOffice `  swapping the council member with a new council member 
```solidity
function removeFromOffice(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 tokenId,
        address rewardRecipient
    ) external onlyRole(GOVERNANCE_COUNCIL_ROLE) {
        // Retrieve and distribute any pending TELCOIN for all council members
        _retrieve();
        // Withdraw all the TELCOIN rewards for the specified token to the rewardRecipient
        _withdrawAll(rewardRecipient, tokenId);
        // Transfer the token (representing the council membership) from one address to another
        _transfer(from, to, tokenId);
    }
```

## Vulnerability Detail
If the new council member `to` is already a council member they'll posses multiple `tokenId` representing their council membership this can have the following impacts;
1- if the council member becomes malicious removing such member will result in only removing one `tokenId` associated with the member, the council member will still be present in the system due to holding other `tokenId `

2- unfair reward distribution, whenever `_retrive` gets called the user will earn for all the `tokenId` held 
## Impact
Membership will become harder to track
