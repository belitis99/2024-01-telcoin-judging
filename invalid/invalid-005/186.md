# Mismatch length of destinations and amounts's length , will cause telcoin distribution fail

## Summary
No checks of array length of telcoin transfer destinations and amounts .

## Vulnerability Detail
In `TelcoinDistributor:executeTransaction`, when several require() statements are passed, the `batchTelcoin` will be executed , but there is no checks of `destinations`'s length and `amounts` matchness .

## Impact
Batch telcoinã€€transfers will fail .

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/protocol/core/TelcoinDistributor.sol#L143-L203

some requires checks before telcoin transfer .
```solidity
     // Makes sure the id exists
        require(
            transactionId < proposedTransactions.length,
            "TelcoinDistributor: Invalid index"
        );
        // Reverts if the challenge period has not expired
        require(
            block.timestamp >
                proposedTransactions[transactionId].timestamp + challengePeriod,
            "TelcoinDistributor: Challenge period has not ended"
        );
        // makes sure the transaction was not challenged
        require(
            !proposedTransactions[transactionId].challenged,
            "TelcoinDistributor: transaction has been challenged"
        );
        // makes sure the transaction was not executed previously
        require(
            !proposedTransactions[transactionId].executed,
            "TelcoinDistributor: transaction has been previously executed"
        );
```

Telcoin transfer execution .
```solidity
   uint256 initialBalance = TELCOIN.balanceOf(address(this));
        //transfers amounts
        TELCOIN.safeTransferFrom(owner(), address(this), totalWithdrawl);
        for (uint i = 0; i < destinations.length; i++) {
            TELCOIN.safeTransfer(destinations[i], amounts[i]);
        }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review, VScode

## Recommendation
Add a new `require` statement to check `destinations`'s length is equals to  `amounts` matchness .
           
```solidity
@+    require( proposedTransactions[transactionId].destinations == proposedTransactions[transactionId].amounts, "TelcoinDistributor: destinations and amounts must be equal")

```
