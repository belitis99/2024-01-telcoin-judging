# `TelcoinDistributor :: batchTelcoin ` function can cause A DOS if array is not the same transaction can revert

## Summary
if the array length for both array is not equal the transaction can revert

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
The `executeTransaction` will execute and funds will not be send

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

check array length for  both arrays that they are equal before running the for loop.
```diff

  function batchTelcoin(
        uint256 totalWithdrawl,
        address[] memory destinations,
        uint256[] memory amounts
    ) internal {
        // stores inital balance
+    require(destinations.length==amounts.length,"array length not equal")
        uint256 initialBalance = TELCOIN.balanceOf(address(this));
        //transfers amounts
        TELCOIN.safeTransferFrom(owner(), address(this), totalWithdrawl);
       for (uint i = 0; i < destinations.length; i++) {
        TELCOIN.safeTransfer(destinations[i], amounts[i]);
        }
        //initial balance is used instead of zero
        //if 0 is used instead stray Telcoin could DNS operations
        require(
            TELCOIN.balanceOf(address(this)) == initialBalance,
            "TelcoinDistributor: must not have leftovers"
        );
    }

```
