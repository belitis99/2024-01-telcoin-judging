# Potential overflow in `TelcoinDistributor` contract's `proposeTransaction` function

## Summary
The `TelcoinDistributor` smart contract, as presented, contains a potential vulnerability in the assignment of the `timestamp` variable. The assignment of `block.timestamp` to `timestamp` without proper validation can lead to an overflow if `block.timestamp` exceeds the maximum value that a `uint64` can represent.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `TelcoinDistributor` contract's `proposeTransaction` function, the `timestamp` variable is assigned the value of `block.timestamp` without any validation. The `timestamp` variable is of type `uint64`, which can represent values from 0 to 2^64-1. However, if `block.timestamp` exceeds this maximum value, an overflow will occur, resulting in an incorrect `timestamp` value.

As there is no check to ensure that `block.timestamp` does not exceed the maximum value representable by a `uint64`, it is possible for an overflow to occur, leading to incorrect timestamps in the `ProposedTransaction` struct.

## Impact
The potential overflow in the assignment of the `timestamp` variable can have a significant impact on the `TelcoinDistributor` contract. If an overflow occurs, the timestamps recorded for proposed transactions will be incorrect, which can lead to various issues, including challenges being initiated or executed at unexpected times. This can disrupt the intended operation of the contract and compromise its functionality.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate the potential overflow vulnerability, it is recommended to add a validation check to ensure that `block.timestamp` does not exceed the maximum value representable by a `uint64` before assigning it to the `timestamp` variable or just to use `uint256` instead of `uint64` for the `timestamp` variable.

Here is the updated code snippet with the recommended validation check:

```diff
// Ensure that block.timestamp does not exceed the maximum value representable by uint64

    function proposeTransaction(
        uint256 totalWithdrawl,
        address[] memory destinations,
        uint256[] memory amounts
    ) external onlyCouncilMember whenNotPaused {
+       require(block.timestamp <= type(uint64).max, "TelcoinDistributor: Timestamp overflow");
        // Pushing the proposed transaction to the array
        proposedTransactions.push(
            ProposedTransaction({
                totalWithdrawl: totalWithdrawl,
                destinations: destinations,
                amounts: amounts,
                timestamp: uint64(block.timestamp),   // H Potential overflow
                challenged: false,
                executed: false
            })
        );

        // Emitting an event after proposing a transaction
        emit TransactionProposed(proposedTransactions.length - 1, _msgSender());
    }


```

By implementing this change, the contract will validate that `block.timestamp` does not exceed the maximum value representable by a `uint64` before recording it as the `timestamp` for proposed transactions, preventing potential overflow issues.
