# `SUPPORT_ROLE` can transfer out `TELCOIN` tokens that are not yet distributed

## Summary
The `SUPPORT_ROLE` can withdraw `TELCOIN` tokens that should be distributed to council members from the `CouncilMember.sol` contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `SUPPORT_ROLE` can call functions to recover ERC20 tokens stuck in the `CouncilMember.sol` contract. The `CouncilMember.sol` contract temporarily holds `TELCOIN` tokens that should be distributed to the council members.

In the `erc20Rescue()` function there is no check to ensure that after the rescue there's enough `TELCOIN` left in the contract for the council members to claim, in fact it's possible to withdraw all of them.

## Impact
The `CouncilMember.sol` might enter a state where it's insolvent towards council members, which might not be able to withdraw their `TELCOIN` tokens.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
When rescuing `TELCOIN` tokens in the `erc20Rescue()` function subtract the amount of tokens currently owed to council members:
```solidity
function erc20Rescue(IERC20 token,address destination,uint256 amount) external onlyRole(SUPPORT_ROLE) { 
    uint256 toDistribute = 0;
    if(token == TELCOIN) {
        for (uint i = 0; i < balances.length; i++) {
            toDistribute += balances[i];
        }
    }
    token.safeTransfer(destination, amount - toDistribute);
}
```
