# Lack of Security Check in recoverERC20FromStaking Function

## Summary
The function currently relies on the existence check (stakingExists[staking]) but does not explicitly verify that staking is of the correct contract type.
## Vulnerability Detail
The recoverERC20FromStaking function in the StakingRewardsManager.sol contract lacks a security check to ensure that the staking contract is a valid instance of the StakingRewards contract. This omission may lead to execution errors and potential vulnerabilities.

## Impact
**Hypothetical Scenario:**

The StakingRewardsManager contract is managing multiple instances of StakingRewards contracts, each associated with different tokens and reward configurations.

**Exploitation:**

An attacker identifies a StakingRewards contract, which is not of the correct type or is a malicious contract deployed to resemble a legitimate staking contract.

The attacker exploits the lack of a type check in the recoverERC20FromStaking function and calls it with the malicious contract as the staking parameter.

**Unauthorized Operation:**

The malicious contract implements the recoverERC20 function to perform unauthorized actions, such as transferring funds to an address controlled by the attacker.

The lack of a proper type check allows the attacker to invoke the recoverERC20 function on the malicious contract, leading to the unauthorized movement of funds.

**Impact:**

As a result of the successful exploitation, the attacker gains control over the recovery process and can divert funds intended for recovery to an unintended destination.

This can lead to financial losses, disruption of the intended operation of the staking contracts, and potential reputational damage for the entire ecosystem relying on the StakingRewardsManager contract.

**Mitigation:**

Implementing a proper type check in the recoverERC20FromStaking function ensures that only instances of the expected StakingRewards contract type can execute the recovery operation. This mitigation prevents unauthorized contracts from manipulating the recovery process, enhancing the security and integrity of the system.

The impact of potential unauthorized operations can be mitigated, safeguarding the functionality and security of the StakingRewardsManager contract and its associated staking contracts.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a security check in the recoverERC20FromStaking function to ensure that the staking contract is an instance of the StakingRewards contract before calling its methods. For example:
```solidity
require(address(staking).isContract(), "Invalid staking contract");
require(staking instanceof StakingRewards, "Invalid staking contract type");
staking.recoverERC20(to, tokenAddress, tokenAmount);
```
This change adds an additional check to verify the contract type before proceeding with the recovery operation.
