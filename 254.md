# Malicious builder can back-run to update malicious config of staking contrat when deploying

## Summary
Malicious builder can back-run to update malicious config of staking contrat when deploying

## Vulnerability Detail
_addStakingRewardsContract use `CREATE1` to deploy contract:

    function createNewStakingRewardsContract(
        IERC20 stakingToken,
        StakingConfig calldata config
    ) external onlyRole(BUILDER_ROLE) {
        // create the new staking contract
        // new staking will have owner and rewardsDistribution set to address(this)
        StakingRewards staking = StakingRewards(
            address(
                stakingRewardsFactory.createStakingRewards(
                    address(this),
                    IERC20(address(rewardToken)),
                    IERC20(stakingToken)
                )
            )
        );
        //internal call to add new contract
        _addStakingRewardsContract(staking, config);
    }

Malicious builder can update new config of the contract by back-run in the same block. since there is no way to update config after deployment
 
## Impact
Malicious builder can update new config of the contract
