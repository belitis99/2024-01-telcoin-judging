# The `topUp()` function distributes tokens to the wrong contracts

## Summary
The `topUp(address source, uint256[] memory indices)` function in `StakingRewardsManager.sol` might distribute rewards to the wrong staking contracts.

## Vulnerability Detail
One of the inputs of the function is an array of indices that indicates the index of the staking contracts to top up in the `stakingContracts` array. 

When getting the address of the staking contract from the array the function uses the wrong index:
```solidity
for (uint i = 0; i < indices.length; i++) {
   StakingRewards staking = stakingContracts[i];
   ...
}
```

The index `i` is used instead of `indices[i]`.

## Impact

The wrong staking reward contracts will be topped up and funds will be distributed to the wrong set of addresses.

## Code Snippet
- [StakingRewards staking = stakingContracts[i]](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/telx/core/StakingRewardsManager.sol#L260)

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Change the line to:
```solidity
StakingRewards staking = stakingContracts[indices[i]];
```
