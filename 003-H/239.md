# There is a misuse of indices input in the topUp function.

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `StakingRewardsManager`, there is a `stakingContracts` array containing all the `stakingRewards` contracts managed by this contract. 
The `topUp` function is used to assign rewards to specific` stakingRewards` contracts, but there is a misuse of `indices` input value.
```solidity
function topUp(address source, uint256[] memory indices) external onlyRole(EXECUTOR_ROLE) {
    for (uint i = 0; i < indices.length; i++) {
        StakingRewards staking = stakingContracts[i];          <== @audit       we should use indices array here
        StakingConfig memory config = stakingConfigs[staking];
    }
}
```
Currently, the function uses the index `i` instead of `indices[i]`. 
In order to send rewards to the last `stakingRewards` contract, it's necessary to include all `stakingRewards` contracts as input and validate the configuration file accordingly.

A notable consideration is the transfer of ownership by the admin for certain `stakingRewards`. 
In such cases, the manager might be restricted from calling the `notifyRewardAmount` function of those `stakingRewards`.
Consequently, it becomes challenging to notify rewards for `stakingRewards` contracts that appear later in the `stakingContract`s array after the one with the ownership transfer.
## Impact
Sending rewards to specific `stakingRewards` contracts poses a challenge.

## Recommendation
```solidity
function topUp(address source, uint256[] memory indices) external onlyRole(EXECUTOR_ROLE) {
    for (uint i = 0; i < indices.length; i++) {
-        StakingRewards staking = stakingContracts[i];  
+        StakingRewards staking = stakingContracts[indices[i]];  
    }
}
```
