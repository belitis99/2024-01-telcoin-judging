# Adding stake contract with different rewards tokens will cause tokens to be stuck

## Summary
In `StakingRewardsManager.sol::addStakingRewardsContract()` The function implementation does not have checks for rewardToken address.
## Vulnerability Detail
It is stated in Natspec that `This function WILL NOT REVERT if staking does not have the right rewardToken`. However, no checks are done. This function is crucial because of `StakingRewardsManager.sol::topUp()`. 

The `topUp()` sends reward token to addresses that are added to the `StakingRewardsManager` contract. If the added contract has different `ERC20 rewardTokens` set up, this means when the `EXECUTOR` calls the `topUp()`, wrong rewards are sent, and that particular staking contract will not update the rewards ratio, and participants are not able to claim tokens.

## Impact
1) `rewardTokens` are stuck in StakingRewards contract.
2) `StakingRewards` rewardRate will not be updated correctly as it uses the ERC20 different token address `balanceOf` function.
3) Participants are not able to claim the rewardTokens sent by manager.

## Recommendation
Check if the `stakingReward` tokens used is the same as `StakingRewardsManager`
