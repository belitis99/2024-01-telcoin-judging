# Missing Import for Ownable2Step Library

## Summary
During a comprehensive review of the Telcoin smart contract code, it has come to my attention that the Ownable2Step library is utilized within the codebase; however, the necessary import statement for this library is absent.
## Vulnerability Detail
The absence of the required import for the Ownable2Step library is a critical issue that can lead to compilation errors, potentially hindering the successful deployment of the smart contract. This oversight may result in unexpected behavior during runtime.

The vulnerability lies in the fact that the Ownable2Step library is used within the code, but the corresponding import statement is missing. This can lead to unresolved references during compilation.
## Impact
The impact of this issue is two-fold:

**Compilation Errors:** The absence of the import statement can prevent the successful compilation of the smart contract, resulting in deployment failures.

**Runtime Issues:** If the code manages to compile without the necessary import, it may lead to runtime issues, as the functionality provided by the Ownable2Step library will not be correctly incorporated.
